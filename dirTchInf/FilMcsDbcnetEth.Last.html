    <br>Ethereum is a peer to peer network where every peer stores the same copy of a blockchain database and runs an Ethereum virtual machine to maintain and alter it’s state. Proof of work is integrated into the blockchain technology by making the creation of a new block require all members of the network undertake the proof of work. Consensus is achieved via incentivization for peers to always accept the longest chain of blocks in the blockchain by distribution of a cryptographic token of value: ‘ether’.
    <br>
    <br>This leaves us with a new piece of technology that does not fit within the client-server model nor does it qualify as a traditional peer-to-peer network as its existence is incentivised meaning it can be relied upon to provide a consistent deterministic service.
    <br>
    <br>Because of its distributed nature and built in cryptographic security it can act as a third party, capable of arbitrating trustlessly, and without interference from outside parties. Through the use of cryptocurrencies decisions made by software can have financial consequences for people, organisations or even other software.

    <br>Ethereum is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency that includes a virtual machine featuring stateful user-created smart contracts and a Turing-complete contract language. Ethereum uses its currency unit, Ether, as payment to incentivise a network of peers to provide computational services defined by the smart contracts deployed on the blockchain.
    <br>
    <br>Ethereum was initially described by Vitalik Buterin in late 2013,[1] formally described by Gavin Wood in early 2014 in the so-called Yellow Paper[2] and launched 30 July 2015.[3] It is among a group of "next generation" (or "Bitcoin 2.0") platforms.[4]

    <br>Ethereum is the world's first publicly accessible computer. Situated on the Internet, anyone may pay a small fee to its open group of maintainers in order to use it. Secured and authenticated through cryptography, it provides a unprecedented opportunity for use as the cornerstone of IoT, Internet-law, smart contracts and the next digital economy.
    <br>[<a href="https://ethcore.io/">https://ethcore.io/</a>]
    <br>===
    <br>The basis for decentralised consensus is the peer-to-peer network of participating nodes which maintain and secure the blockchain.

    <br>Ethereum is a programmable blockchain. Rather than give users a set of pre-defined operations (e.g. bitcoin transactions), Ethereum allows users to create their own operations of any complexity they wish. In this way, it serves as a platform for many different types of decentralized blockchain applications, including but not limited to cryptocurrencies.
    <br>Ethereum in the narrow sense refers to a suite of protocols that define a platform for decentralised applications. At the heart of it is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (“EVM”), which can execute code of arbitrary algorithmic complexity. In computer science terms, Ethereum is “Turing complete”. Developers can create applications that run on the EVM using friendly programming languages modelled on existing languages like javascript and python.

  <p id="idEthattP1">External Actor:
    <br>A person or other entity able to interface to an Ethereum node, but external to the world of Ethereum.
    <br>It can interact with Ethereum through depositing signed Transactions and inspecting the blockchain and associated state.
    <br>Has one (or more) intrinsic Accounts.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthattP1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthattP2">Address:
    <br>A 160-bit code used for identifying Accounts.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthattP2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthattP3">Account:
    <br>Accounts have an intrinsic balance and transaction count maintained as part of the Ethereum state.
    <br>They also have some (possibly empty) EVM Code and a (possibly empty) Storage State associated with them.
    <br>Though homogenous, it makes sense to distinguish between two practical types of account: those with empty associated EVM Code (thus the account balance is controlled, if at all, by some external entity) and those with non-empty associated EVM Code (thus the account represents an Autonomous Object). Each Account has a single Address that identifies it.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthattP3"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthattP4">Transaction: A piece of data, signed by an External Actor. It represents either a Message or a new Autonomous Object. Transactions are recorded into each block of the blockchain.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthattP4"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthattP5">Autonomous Object: A notional object existent only within the hypothetical state of Ethereum. Has an intrinsic address and thus an associated account; the account will have non-empty associated EVM Code. Incorporated only as the Storage State of that account.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthattP5"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthattP6">Storage State: The information particular to a given Account that is maintained between the times that the
    <br>Account’s associated EVM Code runs.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthattP6"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthattP7">Message: Data (as a set of bytes) and Value (specified as Ether) that is passed between two Accounts, either
    <br>through the deterministic operation of an Autonomous Object or the cryptographically secure signature of the Transaction.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthattP7"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthattP8">Message Call: The act of passing a message from one Account to another. If the destination account is associated with non-empty EVM Code, then the VM will be started with the state of said Object and the Message acted upon. If the message sender is an Autonomous Object, then the Call passes any data returned from the VM operation.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthattP8"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthattP9">Gas: The fundamental network cost unit. Paid for exclusively by Ether (as of PoC-4), which is converted freely to and from Gas as required. Gas does not exist outside of the internal Ethereum computation engine; its price is set by the Transaction and miners are free to ignore Transactions whose Gas price is too low.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthattP9"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthattP10">Contract: Informal term used to mean both a piece of EVM Code that may be associated with an Account or an Autonomous Object.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthattP10"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthattP11">Object: Synonym for Autonomous Object.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthattP11"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthattP12">App: An end-user-visible application hosted in the Ethereum Browser.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthattP12"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthattP13">Ethereum Browser: (aka Ethereum Reference Client) A cross-platform GUI of an interface similar to a simplified browser (a la Chrome) that is able to host sandboxed applications whose backend is purely on the Ethereum protocol.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthattP13"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthattP14">Ethereum Virtual Machine: (aka EVM) The virtual machine that forms the key part of the execution model for an Account’s associated EVM Code.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthattP14"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthattP15">Ethereum Runtime Environment: (aka ERE) The environment which is provided to an Autonomous Object executing in the EVM. Includes the EVM but also the structure of the world state on which the EVM relies for certain I/O instructions including CALL & CREATE.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthattP15"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthattP16">EVM Code: The bytecode that the EVM can natively execute. Used to formally specify the meaning and ramifications of a message to an Account.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthattP16"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthattP17">EVM Assembly: The human-readable form of EVM-code.

    <br>The state in Ethereum essentially consists of <strong>a key-value map</strong>, where the keys are addresses and the values are account declarations, listing the balance, nonce, code and storage for each account (where the storage is itself a tree).
    <br>For example, the Morden testnet genesis state looks as follows:

  <p id="idEthstateupdgdsn">Description::
    <br>Unlike transaction history, however, the state needs to be frequently updated: the balance and nonce of accounts is often changed, and what’s more, new accounts are frequently inserted, and keys in storage are frequently inserted and deleted. What is thus desired is a data structure where we can quickly calculate the new tree root after an insert, update edit or delete operation, without recomputing the entire tree. There are also two highly desirable secondary properties:
    <br>
    <br>The depth of the tree is bounded, even given an attacker that is deliberately crafting transactions to make the tree as deep as possible. Otherwise, an attacker could perform a denial of service attack by manipulating the tree to be so deep that each individual update becomes extremely slow.
    <br>The root of the tree depends only on the data, not on the order in which updates are made. Making updates in a different order and even recomputing the tree from scratch should not change the root.

  <p id="idEthwprP4">Satoshi Nakamoto's development of Bitcoin in 2009 has often been hailed as a radical development in money and currency, being the first example of <strong>a digital asset</strong> which simultaneously has no backing or "<a href="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/8640/an-exploration-of-intrinsic-value-what-it-is-why-bitcoin-doesnt-have-it-and-why-bitcoin-does-have-it/">intrinsic value</a>" and no centralized issuer or controller.
    <br>However, another, arguably more important, part of the Bitcoin experiment is the underlying blockchain technology as a tool of distributed consensus, and attention is rapidly starting to shift to this other aspect of Bitcoin.
    <br>Commonly cited alternative applications of blockchain technology include using on-blockchain digital assets to represent custom currencies and financial instruments ("<a href="https://docs.google.com/a/buterin.com/document/d/1AnkP_cVZTCMLIzw4DvsW6M8Q2JC0lIzrTLuoWu2z1BE/edit">colored coins</a>"), the ownership of an underlying physical device ("<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Smart_Property">smart property</a>"), non-fungible assets such as domain names ("<a href="http://namecoin.org">Namecoin</a>"), as well as more complex applications involving having digital assets being directly controlled by a piece of code implementing arbitrary rules ("<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/smart_contracts_idea.html">smart contracts</a>") or even blockchain-based "<a href="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/7050/bootstrapping-a-decentralized-autonomous-corporation-part-i/">decentralized autonomous organizations</a>" (DAOs).
    <br>What Ethereum intends to provide is a blockchain with a built-in fully fledged Turing-complete <strong>programming language</strong> that can be used to create "contracts" that can be used to encode arbitrary state transition functions, allowing users to create any of the systems described above, as well as many others that we have not yet imagined, simply by writing up the logic in a few lines of code.

  <h4 id="idEthwprhstrH4">History
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprhstrH4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idEthwprhstrP1">The concept of decentralized digital currency, as well as alternative applications like property registries, has been around for decades.
    <br>The anonymous e-cash protocols of the 1980s and the 1990s were mostly reliant on a cryptographic primitive known as Chaumian Blinding.
    <br>Chaumian Blinding provided these new currencies with high degrees of privacy, but their underlying protocols largely failed to gain traction because of their reliance on a centralized intermediary.
    <br>In 1998, Wei Dai's <a href="http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt">b-money</a> became the first proposal to introduce the idea of creating money through solving computational puzzles as well as decentralized consensus, but the proposal was scant on details as to how decentralized consensus could actually be implemented.
    <br>In 2005, Hal Finney introduced a concept of "<a href="http://www.finney.org/~hal/rpow/">reusable proofs of work</a>", a system which uses ideas from b-money together with Adam Back's computationally difficult Hashcash puzzles to create a concept for a cryptocurrency, but once again fell short of the ideal by relying on trusted computing as a backend.
    <br>In 2009, a decentralized currency was for the first time implemented in practice by Satoshi Nakamoto, combining established primitives for managing ownership through public key cryptography with a consensus algorithm for keeping track of who owns coins, known as "proof of work."
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprhstrP1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprhstrP2">The mechanism behind proof of work was a breakthrough because it simultaneously solved two problems.
    <br>First, it provided a simple and moderately effective consensus algorithm, allowing nodes in the network to collectively agree on a set of updates to the state of the Bitcoin ledger.
    <br>Second, it provided a mechanism for allowing free entry into the consensus process, solving the political problem of deciding who gets to influence the consensus, while simultaneously preventing Sybil attacks.
    <br>It does this by substituting a formal barrier to participation, such as the requirement to be registered as a unique entity on a particular list, with an economic barrier - the weight of a single node in the consensus voting process is directly proportional to the computing power that the node brings.
    <br>Since then, an alternative approach has been proposed called <span class="clsColorRed">proof of stake</span>, calculating the weight of a node as being proportional to its currency holdings and not its computational resources.
    <br>The discussion concerning the relative merits of the two approaches is beyond the scope of this paper but it should be noted that both approaches can be used to serve as the backbone of a cryptocurrency.

  <h4 id="idEthwprbstsH4">Bitcoin-As-A-State-Transition-System
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprbstsH4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idEthwprbstsP1"><img src="filMcsDtcnet.files/imgEthwprFig1.png">
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprbstsP1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprbstsP2">From a technical standpoint, the ledger of a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin can be thought of as a state transition system, where there is a "state" consisting of <strong>the ownership status of all existing bitcoins</strong> and a "state transition function" that takes a state and a transaction and outputs a new state which is the result.
    <br>In a standard banking system, for example, the state is a balance sheet, a transaction is a request to move $X from A to B, and the state transition function reduces the value of A's account by $X and increases the value of B's account by $X.
    <br>If A's account has less than $X in the first place, the state transition function returns an error.
    <br>Hence, one can formally define:
    <br>
    <br><code>APPLY(S,TX) -> S' or ERROR</code>
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprbstsP2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprbstsP3">In the banking system defined above:
    <br>
    <br><code>APPLY({ Alice: $50, Bob: $50 },"send $20 from Alice to Bob") = { Alice: $30, Bob: $70 }</code>
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprbstsP3"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprbstsP4">But:
    <br>
    <br><code>APPLY({ Alice: $50, Bob: $50 },"send $70 from Alice to Bob") = ERROR</code>
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprbstsP4"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprbstsP5">The "state" in Bitcoin is the collection of all coins (technically, "unspent transaction outputs" or UTXO) that have been minted and not yet spent, with each UTXO having a denomination and an owner (defined by a 20-byte address which is essentially a cryptographic public key[<a class="clsPreview" href="#idEthwprnot1"> 1 </a>]).
    <br>A transaction contains one or more inputs, with each input containing a reference to an existing UTXO and a cryptographic signature produced by the private key associated with the owner's address, and one or more outputs, with each output containing a new UTXO for addition to the state.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprbstsP5"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprbstsP6">The state transition function <code>APPLY(S,TX) -> S'</code> can be defined roughly as follows:
    <br>
    <br>1. For each input in <code>TX</code>:
    <br>    * If the referenced UTXO is not in <code>S</code>, return an error.
    <br>    * If the provided signature does not match the owner of the UTXO, return an error.
    <br>2. If the sum of the denominations of all input UTXO is less than the sum of the denominations of all output UTXO, return an error.
    <br>3. Return <code>S'</code> with all input UTXO removed and all output UTXO added.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprbstsP6"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprbstsP7">The first half of the first step prevents transaction senders from spending coins that do not exist, the second half of the first step prevents transaction senders from spending other people's coins, and the second step enforces conservation of value.
    <br>In order to use this for payment, the protocol is as follows.
    <br>Suppose Alice wants to send 11.7 BTC to Bob.
    <br>First, Alice will look for a set of available UTXO that she owns that totals up to at least 11.7 BTC.
    <br>Realistically, Alice will not be able to get exactly 11.7 BTC; say that the smallest she can get is 6+4+2=12.
    <br>She then creates a transaction with those three inputs and two outputs.
    <br>The first output will be 11.7 BTC with Bob's address as its owner, and the second output will be the remaining 0.3 BTC "change".
    <br>If Alice does not claim this change by sending it to an address owned by herself, the miner will be able to claim it.

  <h4 id="idEthwprmngH4">Mining
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprmngH4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idEthwprmngP1"><img src="filMcsDtcnet.files/imgEthwprFig2.png">
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprmngP1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprmngP2">If we had access to a trustworthy centralized service, this system would be trivial to implement; it could be coded exactly as described, using a centralized server's hard drive to keep track of the state.
    <br>However, with Bitcoin we are trying to build a decentralized currency system, so we will need to combine the state transition system with a consensus system in order to ensure that everyone agrees on the order of transactions.
    <br>Bitcoin's decentralized consensus process requires nodes in the network to continuously attempt to produce packages of transactions called "blocks".
    <br>The network is intended to create one block approximately every ten minutes, with each block containing a timestamp, a nonce, a reference to (i.e., hash of) the previous block and a list of all of the transactions that have taken place since the previous block.
    <br>Over time, this creates a persistent, ever-growing, "blockchain" that continually updates to represent the latest state of the Bitcoin ledger.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprmngP2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprmngP3">The algorithm for checking if a block is valid, expressed in this paradigm, is as follows:
    <br>
    <br>1. Check if the previous block referenced by the block exists and is valid.
    <br>2. Check that the timestamp of the block is greater than that of the previous block[<a class="clsPreview" href="#idEthwprnot2"> 2 </a>] and less than 2 hours into the future
    <br>3. Check that the proof of work on the block is valid.
    <br>4. Let <code>S[0]</code> be the state at the end of the previous block.
    <br>5. Suppose <code>TX</code> is the block's transaction list with <code>n</code> transactions. For all <code>i</code> in <code>0...n-1</code>, set <code>S[i+1] = APPLY(S[i],TX[i])</code> If any application returns an error, exit and return false.
    <br>6. Return true, and register <code>S[n]</code> as the state at the end of this block.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprmngP3"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprmngP4">Essentially, each transaction in the block must provide a valid state transition from what was the canonical state before the transaction was executed to some new state.
    <br>Note that the state is not encoded in the block in any way; it is purely an abstraction to be remembered by the validating node and can only be (securely) computed for any block by starting from the genesis state and sequentially applying every transaction in every block.
    <br>Additionally, note that the order in which the miner includes transactions into the block matters; if there are two transactions A and B in a block such that B spends a UTXO created by A, then the block will be valid if A comes before B but not otherwise.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprmngP4"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprmngP5">The one validity condition present in the above list that is not found in other systems is the requirement for "proof of work".
    <br>The precise condition is that the double-SHA256 hash of every block, treated as a 256-bit number, must be less than a dynamically adjusted target, which as of the time of this writing is approximately 2<sup>187</sup>.
    <br>The purpose of this is to make block creation computationally "hard", thereby preventing Sybil attackers from remaking the entire blockchain in their favor.
    <br>Because SHA256 is designed to be a completely unpredictable pseudorandom function, the only way to create a valid block is simply trial and error, repeatedly incrementing the nonce and seeing if the new hash matches.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprmngP5"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprmngP6">At the current target of ~2<sup>187</sup>, the network must make an average of ~2<sup>69</sup> tries before a valid block is found; in general, the target is recalibrated by the network every 2016 blocks so that on average a new block is produced by some node in the network every ten minutes.
    <br>In order to compensate miners for this computational work, the miner of every block is entitled to include a transaction giving themselves 25 BTC out of nowhere.
    <br>Additionally, if any transaction has a higher total denomination in its inputs than in its outputs, the difference also goes to the miner as a "transaction fee".
    <br>Incidentally, this is also the only mechanism by which BTC are issued; the genesis state contained no coins at all.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprmngP6"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprmngP7">In order to better understand the purpose of mining, let us examine what happens in the event of a malicious attacker.
    <br>Since Bitcoin's underlying cryptography is known to be secure, the attacker will target the one part of the Bitcoin system that is not protected by cryptography directly: the order of transactions.
    <br>The attacker's strategy is simple:
    <br>
    <br>1. Send 100 BTC to a merchant in exchange for some product (preferably a rapid-delivery digital good)
    <br>2. Wait for the delivery of the product
    <br>3. Produce another transaction sending the same 100 BTC to himself
    <br>4. Try to convince the network that his transaction to himself was the one that came first.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprmngP7"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprmngP8">Once step (1) has taken place, after a few minutes some miner will include the transaction in a block, say block number 270000.
    <br>After about one hour, five more blocks will have been added to the chain after that block, with each of those blocks indirectly pointing to the transaction and thus "confirming" it.
    <br>At this point, the merchant will accept the payment as finalized and deliver the product; since we are assuming this is a digital good, delivery is instant.
    <br>Now, the attacker creates another transaction sending the 100 BTC to himself.
    <br>If the attacker simply releases it into the wild, the transaction will not be processed; miners will attempt to run <code>APPLY(S,TX)</code> and notice that <code>TX</code> consumes a UTXO which is no longer in the state.
    <br>So instead, the attacker creates a "fork" of the blockchain, starting by mining another version of block 270000 pointing to the same block 269999 as a parent but with the new transaction in place of the old one.
    <br>Because the block data is different, this requires redoing the proof of work. Furthermore, the attacker's new version of block 270000 has a different hash, so the original blocks 270001 to 270005 do not "point" to it; thus, the original chain and the attacker's new chain are completely separate.
    <br>The rule is that in a fork the longest blockchain is taken to be the truth, and so legitimate miners will work on the 270005 chain while the attacker alone is working on the 270000 chain.
    <br>In order for the attacker to make his blockchain the longest, he would need to have more computational power than the rest of the network combined in order to catch up (hence, "51% attack").

  <p id="idEthwprmtrP1"><img src="filMcsDtcnet.files/imgEthwprFig3.png">
    <br>01: it suffices to present only a small number of nodes in a Merkle tree to give a proof of the validity of a branch.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprmtrP1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprmtrP2"><img src="filMcsDtcnet.files/imgEthwprFig4.png">
    <br>02: any attempt to change any part of the Merkle tree will eventually lead to an inconsistency somewhere up the chain.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprmtrP2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprmtrP3">An important scalability feature of Bitcoin is that the block is stored in a multi-level data structure.
    <br>The "hash" of a block is actually only the hash of the block header, a roughly 200-byte piece of data that contains the timestamp, nonce, previous block hash and the root hash of a data structure called the Merkle tree storing all transactions in the block.
    <br>A Merkle tree is a type of binary tree, composed of a set of nodes with a large number of leaf nodes at the bottom of the tree containing the underlying data, a set of intermediate nodes where each node is the hash of its two children, and finally a single root node, also formed from the hash of its two children, representing the "top" of the tree.
    <br>The purpose of the Merkle tree is to allow the data in a block to be delivered piecemeal: a node can download only the header of a block from one source, the small part of the tree relevant to them from another source, and still be assured that all of the data is correct.
    <br>The reason why this works is that hashes propagate upward: if a malicious user attempts to swap in a fake transaction into the bottom of a Merkle tree, this change will cause a change in the node above, and then a change in the node above that, finally changing the root of the tree and therefore the hash of the block, causing the protocol to register it as a completely different block (almost certainly with an invalid proof of work).
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprmtrP3"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprmtrP4">The Merkle tree protocol is arguably essential to long-term sustainability.
    <br>A "full node" in the Bitcoin network, one that stores and processes the entirety of every block, takes up about 15 GB of disk space in the Bitcoin network as of April 2014, and is growing by over a gigabyte per month.
    <br>Currently, this is viable for some desktop computers and not phones, and later on in the future only businesses and hobbyists will be able to participate.
    <br>A protocol known as "simplified payment verification" (SPV) allows for another class of nodes to exist, called "light nodes", which download the block headers, verify the proof of work on the block headers, and then download only the "branches" associated with transactions that are relevant to them.
    <br>This allows light nodes to determine with a strong guarantee of security what the status of any Bitcoin transaction, and their current balance, is while downloading only a very small portion of the entire blockchain.

  <h4 id="idEthwprabaH4">Alternative-Blockchain-Applications
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprabaH4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idEthwprabaP1">The idea of taking the underlying blockchain idea and applying it to other concepts also has a long history.
    <br>In 2005, Nick Szabo came out with the concept of "<a href="http://nakamotoinstitute.org/secure-property-titles">secure property titles with owner authority</a>", a document describing how "new advances in replicated database technology" will allow for a blockchain-based system for storing a registry of who owns what land, creating an elaborate framework including concepts such as homesteading, adverse possession and Georgian land tax.
    <br>However, there was unfortunately no effective replicated database system available at the time, and so the protocol was never implemented in practice.
    <br>After 2009, however, once Bitcoin's decentralized consensus was developed a number of alternative applications rapidly began to emerge.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprabaP1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprabaP2">* <strong>Namecoin</strong> - created in 2010, <a href="https://namecoin.org/">Namecoin</a> is best described as a decentralized name registration database.
    <br>In decentralized protocols like Tor, Bitcoin and BitMessage, there needs to be some way of identifying accounts so that other people can interact with them, but in all existing solutions the only kind of identifier available is a pseudorandom hash like <code>1LW79wp5ZBqaHW1jL5TCiBCrhQYtHagUWy</code>.
    <br>Ideally, one would like to be able to have an account with a name like "george".
    <br>However, the problem is that if one person can create an account named "george" then someone else can use the same process to register "george" for themselves as well and impersonate them.
    <br>The only solution is a first-to-file paradigm, where the first registerer succeeds and the second fails - a problem perfectly suited for the Bitcoin consensus protocol.
    <br>Namecoin is the oldest, and most successful, implementation of a name registration system using such an idea.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprabaP2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprabaP3">* <strong>Colored coins</strong> - the purpose of <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/buterin.com/document/d/1AnkP_cVZTCMLIzw4DvsW6M8Q2JC0lIzrTLuoWu2z1BE/edit">colored coins</a> is to serve as a protocol to allow people to create their own digital currencies - or, in the important trivial case of a currency with one unit, digital tokens, on the Bitcoin blockchain.
    <br>In the colored coins protocol, one "issues" a new currency by publicly assigning a color to a specific Bitcoin UTXO, and the protocol recursively defines the color of other UTXO to be the same as the color of the inputs that the transaction creating them spent (some special rules apply in the case of mixed-color inputs).
    <br>This allows users to maintain wallets containing only UTXO of a specific color and send them around much like regular bitcoins, backtracking through the blockchain to determine the color of any UTXO that they receive.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprabaP3"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprabaP4">* <strong>Metacoins</strong> - the idea behind a metacoin is to have a protocol that lives on top of Bitcoin, using Bitcoin transactions to store metacoin transactions but having a different state transition function, <code>APPLY'</code>.
    <br>Because the metacoin protocol cannot prevent invalid metacoin transactions from appearing in the Bitcoin blockchain, a rule is added that if <code>APPLY'(S,TX)</code> returns an error, the protocol defaults to <code>APPLY'(S,TX) = S</code>.
    <br>This provides an easy mechanism for creating an arbitrary cryptocurrency protocol, potentially with advanced features that cannot be implemented inside of Bitcoin itself, but with a very low development cost since the complexities of mining and networking are already handled by the Bitcoin protocol.
    <br>Metacoins have been used to implement some classes of financial contracts, name registration and decentralized exchange.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprabaP4"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprabaP5">Thus, in general, there are two approaches toward building a consensus protocol: building an independent network, and building a protocol on top of Bitcoin.
    <br>The former approach, while reasonably successful in the case of applications like Namecoin, is difficult to implement; each individual implementation needs to bootstrap an independent blockchain, as well as building and testing all of the necessary state transition and networking code.
    <br>Additionally, we predict that the set of applications for decentralized consensus technology will follow a power law distribution where the vast majority of applications would be too small to warrant their own blockchain, and we note that there exist large classes of decentralized applications, particularly decentralized autonomous organizations, that need to interact with each other.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprabaP5"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprabaP6">The Bitcoin-based approach, on the other hand, has the flaw that it does not inherit the simplified payment verification features of Bitcoin.
    <br>SPV works for Bitcoin because it can use blockchain depth as a proxy for validity; at some point, once the ancestors of a transaction go far enough back, it is safe to say that they were legitimately part of the state.
    <br>Blockchain-based meta-protocols, on the other hand, cannot force the blockchain not to include transactions that are not valid within the context of their own protocols.
    <br>Hence, a fully secure SPV meta-protocol implementation would need to backward scan all the way to the beginning of the Bitcoin blockchain to determine whether or not certain transactions are valid.
    <br>Currently, all "light" implementations of Bitcoin-based meta-protocols rely on a trusted server to provide the data, arguably a highly suboptimal result especially when one of the primary purposes of a cryptocurrency is to eliminate the need for trust.

  <section id="idEthwprscr">
  <h4 id="idEthwprscrH4">Scripting
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprscrH4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idEthwprscrP1">Even without any extensions, the Bitcoin protocol actually does facilitate a weak version of a concept of "smart contracts".
    <br>UTXO in Bitcoin can be owned not just by a public key, but also by a more complicated script expressed in a simple stack-based programming language.
    <br>In this paradigm, a transaction spending that UTXO must provide data that satisfies the script.
    <br>Indeed, even the basic public key ownership mechanism is implemented via a script: the script takes an elliptic curve signature as input, verifies it against the transaction and the address that owns the UTXO, and returns 1 if the verification is successful and 0 otherwise.
    <br>Other, more complicated, scripts exist for various additional use cases.
    <br>For example, one can construct a script that requires signatures from two out of a given three private keys to validate ("multisig"), a setup useful for corporate accounts, secure savings accounts and some merchant escrow situations.
    <br>Scripts can also be used to pay bounties for solutions to computational problems, and one can even construct a script that says something like "this Bitcoin UTXO is yours if you can provide an SPV proof that you sent a Dogecoin transaction of this denomination to me", essentially allowing decentralized cross-cryptocurrency exchange.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprscrP1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprscrP2">However, the scripting language as implemented in Bitcoin has several important limitations:
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprscrP2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprscrP3">* <strong>Lack of Turing-completeness</strong> - that is to say, while there is a large subset of computation that the Bitcoin scripting language supports, it does not nearly support everything.
    <br>The main category that is missing is loops.
    <br>This is done to avoid infinite loops during transaction verification; theoretically it is a surmountable obstacle for script programmers, since any loop can be simulated by simply repeating the underlying code many times with an if statement, but it does lead to scripts that are very space-inefficient.
    <br>For example, implementing an alternative elliptic curve signature algorithm would likely require 256 repeated multiplication rounds all individually included in the code.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprscrP3"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprscrP4">* <strong>Value-blindness</strong> - there is no way for a UTXO script to provide fine-grained control over the amount that can be withdrawn.
    <br>For example, one powerful use case of an oracle contract would be a hedging contract, where A and B put in $1000 worth of BTC and after 30 days the script sends $1000 worth of BTC to A and the rest to B.
    <br>This would require an oracle to determine the value of 1 BTC in USD, but even then it is a massive improvement in terms of trust and infrastructure requirement over the fully centralized solutions that are available now.
    <br>However, because UTXO are all-or-nothing, the only way to achieve this is through the very inefficient hack of having many UTXO of varying denominations (eg. one UTXO of 2<sup>k</sup> for every k up to 30) and having O pick which UTXO to send to A and which to B.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprscrP4"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprscrP5">* <strong>Lack of state</strong> - UTXO can either be spent or unspent; there is no opportunity for multi-stage contracts or scripts which keep any other internal state beyond that.
    <br>This makes it hard to make multi-stage options contracts, decentralized exchange offers or two-stage cryptographic commitment protocols (necessary for secure computational bounties).
    <br>It also means that UTXO can only be used to build simple, one-off contracts and not more complex "stateful" contracts such as decentralized organizations, and makes meta-protocols difficult to implement.
    <br>Binary state combined with value-blindness also mean that another important application, withdrawal limits, is impossible.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprscrP5"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprscrP6">* <strong>Blockchain-blindness</strong> - UTXO are blind to certain blockchain data such as the nonce and previous block hash.
    <br>This severely limits applications in gambling, and several other categories, by depriving the scripting language of a potentially valuable source of randomness.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprscrP6"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprscrP7">Thus, we see three approaches to building advanced applications on top of cryptocurrency: building a new blockchain, using scripting on top of Bitcoin, and building a meta-protocol on top of Bitcoin.
    <br>Building a new blockchain allows for unlimited freedom in building a feature set, but at the cost of development time, bootstrapping effort and security.
    <br>Using scripting is easy to implement and standardize, but is very limited in its capabilities, and meta-protocols, while easy, suffer from faults in scalability.
    <br>With Ethereum, we intend to build an alternative framework that provides even larger gains in ease of development as well as even stronger light client properties, while at the same time allowing applications to share an economic environment and blockchain security.

  <p id="idEthwprethP1">The intent of Ethereum is to create an alternative protocol for building decentralized applications, providing a different set of tradeoffs that we believe will be very useful for a large class of decentralized applications, with particular emphasis on situations where rapid development time, security for small and rarely used applications, and the ability of different applications to very efficiently interact, are important.
    <br>Ethereum does this by building what is essentially the ultimate abstract foundational layer: <strong>a blockchain with a built-in Turing-complete programming language</strong>, allowing anyone to write smart contracts and decentralized applications where they can create their own arbitrary rules for ownership, transaction formats and state transition functions.
    <br>A bare-bones version of Namecoin can be written in two lines of code, and other protocols like currencies and reputation systems can be built in under twenty.
    <br>Smart contracts, cryptographic "boxes" that contain value and only unlock it if certain conditions are met, can also be built on top of the platform, with vastly more power than that offered by Bitcoin scripting because of the added powers of Turing-completeness, value-awareness, blockchain-awareness and state.

  <h4 id="idEthwpractH4">Ethereum-Accounts
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwpractH4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idEthwpractP1">In Ethereum, the state is made up of objects called "accounts", with each account having a 20-byte address and state transitions being direct transfers of value and information between accounts.
    <br>An Ethereum account contains four fields:
    <br>
    <br>* The <strong>nonce</strong>, a counter used to make sure each transaction can only be processed once
    <br>* The account's current <strong>ether balance</strong>
    <br>* The account's <strong>contract code</strong>, if present
    <br>* The account's <strong>storage</strong> (empty by default)
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwpractP1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwpractP2">"Ether" is the main internal crypto-fuel of Ethereum, and is used to pay transaction fees.
    <br>In general, there are two types of accounts: <strong>externally owned accounts</strong>, controlled by private keys, and <strong>contract accounts</strong>, controlled by their contract code.
    <br>An externally owned account has no code, and one can send messages from an externally owned account by creating and signing a transaction; in a contract account, every time the contract account receives a message its code activates, allowing it to read and write to internal storage and send other messages or create contracts in turn.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwpractP2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwpractP3">Note that "contracts" in Ethereum should not be seen as something that should be "fulfilled" or "complied with"; rather, they are more like "autonomous agents" that live inside of the Ethereum execution environment, always executing a specific piece of code when "poked" by a message or transaction, and having direct control over their own ether balance and their own key/value store to keep track of persistent variables.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprmatH4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idEthwprmatP1">The term "transaction" is used in Ethereum to refer to the signed data package that stores a message to be sent from an externally owned account.
    <br>Transactions contain:
    <br>
    <br>* The recipient of the message
    <br>* A signature identifying the sender
    <br>* The amount of ether to transfer from the sender to the recipient
    <br>* An optional data field
    <br>* A <code>STARTGAS</code> value, representing the maximum number of computational steps the transaction execution is allowed to take
    <br>* A <code>GASPRICE</code> value, representing the fee the sender pays per computational step
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprmatP1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprmatP2">The first three are standard fields expected in any cryptocurrency.
    <br>The data field has no function by default, but the virtual machine has an opcode with which a contract can access the data; as an example use case, if a contract is functioning as an on-blockchain domain registration service, then it may wish to interpret the data being passed to it as containing two "fields", the first field being a domain to register and the second field being the IP address to register it to.
    <br>The contract would read these values from the message data and appropriately place them in storage.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprmatP2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprmatP3">The <code>STARTGAS</code> and <code>GASPRICE</code> fields are crucial for Ethereum's anti-denial of service model.
    <br>In order to prevent accidental or hostile infinite loops or other computational wastage in code, each transaction is required to set a limit to how many computational steps of code execution it can use.
    <br>The fundamental unit of computation is "gas"; usually, a computational step costs 1 gas, but some operations cost higher amounts of gas because they are more computationally expensive, or increase the amount of data that must be stored as part of the state.
    <br>There is also a fee of 5 gas for every byte in the transaction data.
    <br>The intent of the fee system is to require an attacker to pay proportionately for every resource that they consume, including computation, bandwidth and storage; hence, any transaction that leads to the network consuming a greater amount of any of these resources must have a gas fee roughly proportional to the increment.

  <h4 id="idEthwprmsgH4">Messages
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprmsgH4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idEthwprmsgP1">Contracts have the ability to send "messages" to other contracts.
    <br>Messages are virtual objects that are never serialized and exist only in the Ethereum execution environment.
    <br>A message contains:
    <br>
    <br>* The sender of the message (implicit)
    <br>* The recipient of the message
    <br>* The amount of ether to transfer alongside the message
    <br>* An optional data field
    <br>* A <code>STARTGAS</code> value
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprmsgP1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprmsgP2">Essentially, a message is like a transaction, except it is produced by a contract and not an external actor.
    <br>A message is produced when a contract currently executing code executes the <code>CALL</code> opcode, which produces and executes a message.
    <br>Like a transaction, a message leads to the recipient account running its code.
    <br>Thus, contracts can have relationships with other contracts in exactly the same way that external actors can.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprmsgP2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprmsgP3">Note that the gas allowance assigned by a transaction or contract applies to the total gas consumed by that transaction and all sub-executions.
    <br>For example, if an external actor A sends a transaction to B with 1000 gas, and B consumes 600 gas before sending a message to C, and the internal execution of C consumes 300 gas before returning, then B can spend another 100 gas before running out of gas.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprestfP1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprestfP2">The Ethereum state transition function, <code>APPLY(S,TX) -> S'</code> can be defined as follows:
    <br>
    <br>1. Check if the transaction is well-formed (ie. has the right number of values), the signature is valid, and the nonce matches the nonce in the sender's account. If not, return an error.
    <br>2. Calculate the transaction fee as <code>STARTGAS * GASPRICE</code>, and determine the sending address from the signature. Subtract the fee from the sender's account balance and increment the sender's nonce. If there is not enough balance to spend, return an error.
    <br>3. Initialize <code>GAS = STARTGAS</code>, and take off a certain quantity of gas per byte to pay for the bytes in the transaction.
    <br>4. Transfer the transaction value from the sender's account to the receiving account. If the receiving account does not yet exist, create it. If the receiving account is a contract, run the contract's code either to completion or until the execution runs out of gas.
    <br>5. If the value transfer failed because the sender did not have enough money, or the code execution ran out of gas, revert all state changes except the payment of the fees, and add the fees to the miner's account.
    <br>6. Otherwise, refund the fees for all remaining gas to the sender, and send the fees paid for gas consumed to the miner.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprestfP2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprestfP3">For example, suppose that the contract's code is:
    <br>
    <br><code>if !self.storage[calldataload(0)]:
    <br> &nbsp;self.storage[calldataload(0)] = calldataload(32)</code>
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprestfP3"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprestfP4">Note that in reality the contract code is written in the low-level EVM code; this example is written in Serpent, one of our high-level languages, for clarity, and can be compiled down to EVM code.
    <br>Suppose that the contract's storage starts off empty, and a transaction is sent with 10 ether value, 2000 gas, 0.001 ether gasprice, and 64 bytes of data, with bytes 0-31 representing the number <code>2</code> and bytes 32-63 representing the string <code>CHARLIE</code>.
    <br>The process for the state transition function in this case is as follows:
    <br>
    <br>1. Check that the transaction is valid and well formed.
    <br>2. Check that the transaction sender has at least 2000 * 0.001 = 2 ether. If it is, then subtract 2 ether from the sender's account.
    <br>3. Initialize gas = 2000; assuming the transaction is 170 bytes long and the byte-fee is 5, subtract 850 so that there is 1150 gas left.
    <br>3. Subtract 10 more ether from the sender's account, and add it to the contract's account.
    <br>4. Run the code. In this case, this is simple: it checks if the contract's storage at index <code>2</code> is used, notices that it is not, and so it sets the storage at index <code>2</code> to the value <code>CHARLIE</code>. Suppose this takes 187 gas, so the remaining amount of gas is 1150 - 187 = 963
    <br>5. Add 963 * 0.001 = 0.963 ether back to the sender's account, and return the resulting state.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprestfP4"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprestfP5">If there was no contract at the receiving end of the transaction, then the total transaction fee would simply be equal to the provided <code>GASPRICE</code> multiplied by the length of the transaction in bytes, and the data sent alongside the transaction would be irrelevant.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprestfP5"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprestfP6">Note that messages work equivalently to transactions in terms of reverts: if a message execution runs out of gas, then that message's execution, and all other executions triggered by that execution, revert, but parent executions do not need to revert.
    <br>This means that it is "safe" for a contract to call another contract, as if A calls B with G gas then A's execution is guaranteed to lose at most G gas.
    <br>Finally, note that there is an opcode, <code>CREATE</code>, that creates a contract; its execution mechanics are generally similar to <code>CALL</code>, with the exception that the output of the execution determines the code of a newly created contract.

  <h4 id="idEthwprcdenH4">Code-Execution
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprcdenH4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idEthwprcdenP1">The code in Ethereum contracts is written in a low-level, stack-based bytecode language, referred to as "Ethereum virtual machine code" or "EVM code".
    <br>The code consists of a series of bytes, where each byte represents an operation.
    <br>In general, code execution is an infinite loop that consists of repeatedly carrying out the operation at the current program counter (which begins at zero) and then incrementing the program counter by one, until the end of the code is reached or an error or <code>STOP</code> or <code>RETURN</code> instruction is detected.
    <br>The operations have access to three types of space in which to store data:
    <br>
    <br>* The <strong>stack</strong>, a last-in-first-out container to which values can be pushed and popped
    <br>* <strong>Memory</strong>, an infinitely expandable byte array
    <br>* The contract's long-term <strong>storage</strong>, a key/value store. Unlike stack and memory, which reset after computation ends, storage persists for the long term.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprcdenP1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprcdenP2">The code can also access the value, sender and data of the incoming message, as well as block header data, and the code can also return a byte array of data as an output.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprcdenP2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprcdenP3">The formal execution model of EVM code is surprisingly simple.
    <br>While the Ethereum virtual machine is running, its full computational state can be defined by the tuple <code>(block_state, transaction, message, code, memory, stack, pc, gas)</code>, where <code>block_state</code> is the global state containing all accounts and includes balances and storage.
    <br>At the start of every round of execution, the current instruction is found by taking the <code>pc</code>th (Program Counter) byte of <code>code</code> (or 0 if <code>pc >= len(code)</code>), and each instruction has its own definition in terms of how it affects the tuple.
    <br>For example, <code>ADD</code> pops two items off the stack and pushes their sum, reduces <code>gas</code> by 1 and increments <code>pc</code> by 1, and <code>SSTORE</code> pops the top two items off the stack and inserts the second item into the contract's storage at the index specified by the first item.
    <br>Although there are many ways to optimize Ethereum virtual machine execution via just-in-time compilation, a basic implementation of Ethereum can be done in a few hundred lines of code.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprbamP1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprbamP2">The Ethereum blockchain is in many ways similar to the Bitcoin blockchain, although it does have some differences.
    <br>The main difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin with regard to the blockchain architecture is that, unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum blocks contain a copy of both the transaction list and the most recent state.
    <br>Aside from that, two other values, the block number and the difficulty, are also stored in the block.
    <br>The basic block validation algorithm in Ethereum is as follows:
    <br>
    <br>1. Check if the previous block referenced exists and is valid.
    <br>2. Check that the timestamp of the block is greater than that of the referenced previous block and less than 15 minutes into the future
    <br>3. Check that the block number, difficulty, transaction root, uncle root and gas limit (various low-level Ethereum-specific concepts) are valid.
    <br>4. Check that the proof of work on the block is valid.
    <br>5. Let <code>S[0]</code> be the state at the end of the previous block.
    <br>6. Let <code>TX</code> be the block's transaction list, with <code>n</code> transactions. For all <code>i</code> in <code>0...n-1</code>, set <code>S[i+1] = APPLY(S[i],TX[i])</code>. If any application returns an error, or if the total gas consumed in the block up until this point exceeds the <code>GASLIMIT</code>, return an error.
    <br>7. Let <code>S_FINAL</code> be <code>S[n]</code>, but adding the block reward paid to the miner.
    <br>8. Check if the Merkle tree root of the state <code>S_FINAL</code> is equal to the final state root provided in the block header. If it is, the block is valid; otherwise, it is not valid.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprbamP2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprbamP3">The approach may seem highly inefficient at first glance, because it needs to store the entire state with each block, but in reality efficiency should be comparable to that of Bitcoin.
    <br>The reason is that the state is stored in the tree structure, and after every block only a small part of the tree needs to be changed.
    <br>Thus, in general, between two adjacent blocks the vast majority of the tree should be the same, and therefore the data can be stored once and referenced twice using pointers (ie. hashes of subtrees).
    <br>A special kind of tree known as a "Patricia tree" is used to accomplish this, including a modification to the Merkle tree concept that allows for nodes to be inserted and deleted, and not just changed, efficiently.
    <br>Additionally, because all of the state information is part of the last block, there is no need to store the entire blockchain history - a strategy which, if it could be applied to Bitcoin, can be calculated to provide 5-20x savings in space.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprbamP3"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprbamP4">A commonly asked question is "where" contract code is executed, in terms of physical hardware.
    <br>This has a simple answer: the process of executing contract code is part of the definition of the state transition function, which is part of the block validation algorithm, so if a transaction is added into block <code>B</code> the code execution spawned by that transaction will be executed by all nodes, now and in the future, that download and validate block <code>B</code>.

    <br>The first category is financial applications, providing users with more powerful ways of managing and entering into contracts using their money.
    <br>This includes sub-currencies, financial derivatives, hedging contracts, savings wallets, wills, and ultimately even some classes of full-scale employment contracts.
    <br>The second category is semi-financial applications, where money is involved but there is also a heavy non-monetary side to what is being done; a perfect example is self-enforcing bounties for solutions to computational problems.
    <br>Finally, there are applications such as online voting and decentralized governance that are not financial at all.

  <h4 id="idEthwprtsmH4">Token Systems
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprtsmH4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idEthwprtsmP1">On-blockchain token systems have many applications ranging from sub-currencies representing assets such as USD or gold to company stocks, individual tokens representing smart property, secure unforgeable coupons, and even token systems with no ties to conventional value at all, used as point systems for incentivization.
    <br>Token systems are surprisingly easy to implement in Ethereum.
    <br>The key point to understand is that all a currency, or token system, fundamentally is a database with one operation: subtract X units from A and give X units to B, with the proviso that (i) A had at least X units before the transaction and (ii) the transaction is approved by A.
    <br>All that it takes to implement a token system is to implement this logic into a contract.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprtsmP1"></a></p>
  <div id="idEthwprtsmP2">
    <p>The basic code for implementing a token system in Serpent looks as follows:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
def send(to, value):
    if self.storage[msg.sender] >= value:
        self.storage[msg.sender] = self.storage[msg.sender] - value
        self.storage[to] = self.storage[to] + value
    </code></pre>
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprtsmP2"></a></div>
  <p id="idEthwprtsmP3">This is essentially a literal implementation of the "banking system" state transition function described further above in this document.
    <br>A few extra lines of code need to be added to provide for the initial step of distributing the currency units in the first place and a few other edge cases, and ideally a function would be added to let other contracts query for the balance of an address.
    <br>But that's all there is to it.
    <br>Theoretically, Ethereum-based token systems acting as sub-currencies can potentially include another important feature that on-chain Bitcoin-based meta-currencies lack: the ability to pay transaction fees directly in that currency.
    <br>The way this would be implemented is that the contract would maintain an ether balance with which it would refund ether used to pay fees to the sender, and it would refill this balance by collecting the internal currency units that it takes in fees and reselling them in a constant running auction.
    <br>Users would thus need to "activate" their accounts with ether, but once the ether is there it would be reusable because the contract would refund it each time.

  <h4 id="idEthwprfdasvcH4">Financial-derivatives-and-Stable-Value-Currencies
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprfdasvcH4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idEthwprfdasvcP1">Financial derivatives are the most common application of a "smart contract", and one of the simplest to implement in code.
    <br>The main challenge in implementing financial contracts is that the majority of them require reference to an external price ticker; for example, a very desirable application is a smart contract that hedges against the volatility of ether (or another cryptocurrency) with respect to the US dollar, but doing this requires the contract to know what the value of ETH/USD is.
    <br>The simplest way to do this is through a "data feed" contract maintained by a specific party (eg. NASDAQ) designed so that that party has the ability to update the contract as needed, and providing an interface that allows other contracts to send a message to that contract and get back a response that provides the price.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprfdasvcP1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprfdasvcP2">Given that critical ingredient, the hedging contract would look as follows:
    <br>
    <br>1. Wait for party A to input 1000 ether.
    <br>2. Wait for party B to input 1000 ether.
    <br>3. Record the USD value of 1000 ether, calculated by querying the data feed contract, in storage, say this is $x.
    <br>4. After 30 days, allow A or B to "reactivate" the contract in order to send $x worth of ether (calculated by querying the data feed contract again to get the new price) to A and the rest to B.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprfdasvcP2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprfdasvcP3">Such a contract would have significant potential in crypto-commerce.
    <br>One of the main problems cited about cryptocurrency is the fact that it's volatile; although many users and merchants may want the security and convenience of dealing with cryptographic assets, they may not wish to face that prospect of losing 23% of the value of their funds in a single day.
    <br>Up until now, the most commonly proposed solution has been issuer-backed assets; the idea is that an issuer creates a sub-currency in which they have the right to issue and revoke units, and provide one unit of the currency to anyone who provides them (offline) with one unit of a specified underlying asset (eg. gold, USD).
    <br>The issuer then promises to provide one unit of the underlying asset to anyone who sends back one unit of the crypto-asset.
    <br>This mechanism allows any non-cryptographic asset to be "uplifted" into a cryptographic asset, provided that the issuer can be trusted.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprfdasvcP3"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprfdasvcP4">In practice, however, issuers are not always trustworthy, and in some cases the banking infrastructure is too weak, or too hostile, for such services to exist.
    <br>Financial derivatives provide an alternative.
    <br>Here, instead of a single issuer providing the funds to back up an asset, a decentralized market of speculators, betting that the price of a cryptographic reference asset (eg. ETH) will go up, plays that role.
    <br>Unlike issuers, speculators have no option to default on their side of the bargain because the hedging contract holds their funds in escrow.
    <br>Note that this approach is not fully decentralized, because a trusted source is still needed to provide the price ticker, although arguably even still this is a massive improvement in terms of reducing infrastructure requirements (unlike being an issuer, issuing a price feed requires no licenses and can likely be categorized as free speech) and reducing the potential for fraud.

    <br>Here is the basic contract to provide a Namecoin-like name registration system on Ethereum:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
def register(name, value):
    if !self.storage[name]:
        self.storage[name] = value
    </code></pre>
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwpriarsP1"></a></div>
  <p id="idEthwpriarsP2">The contract is very simple; all it is is a database inside the Ethereum network that can be added to, but not modified or removed from.
    <br>Anyone can register a name with some value, and that registration then sticks forever.
    <br>A more sophisticated name registration contract will also have a "function clause" allowing other contracts to query it, as well as a mechanism for the "owner" (ie. the first registerer) of a name to change the data or transfer ownership.
    <br>One can even add reputation and web-of-trust functionality on top.

  <h4 id="idEthwprdfsH4">Decentralized-File-Storage
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprdfsH4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idEthwprdfsP1">Over the past few years, there have emerged a number of popular online file storage startups, the most prominent being Dropbox, seeking to allow users to upload a backup of their hard drive and have the service store the backup and allow the user to access it in exchange for a monthly fee.
    <br>However, at this point the file storage market is at times relatively inefficient; a cursory look at various <a href="http://online-storage-service-review.toptenreviews.com/">existing solutions</a> shows that, particularly at the "uncanny valley" 20-200 GB level at which neither free quotas nor enterprise-level discounts kick in, monthly prices for mainstream file storage costs are such that you are paying for more than the cost of the entire hard drive in a single month.
    <br>Ethereum contracts can allow for the development of a decentralized file storage ecosystem, where individual users can earn small quantities of money by renting out their own hard drives and unused space can be used to further drive down the costs of file storage.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprdfsP1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprdfsP2">The key underpinning piece of such a device would be what we have termed the "decentralized Dropbox contract".
    <br>This contract works as follows.
    <br>First, one splits the desired data up into blocks, encrypting each block for privacy, and builds a Merkle tree out of it.
    <br>One then makes a contract with the rule that, every N blocks, the contract would pick a random index in the Merkle tree (using the previous block hash, accessible from contract code, as a source of randomness), and give X ether to the first entity to supply a transaction with a simplified payment verification-like proof of ownership of the block at that particular index in the tree.
    <br>When a user wants to re-download their file, they can use a micropayment channel protocol (eg. pay 1 szabo per 32 kilobytes) to recover the file; the most fee-efficient approach is for the payer not to publish the transaction until the end, instead replacing the transaction with a slightly more lucrative one with the same nonce after every 32 kilobytes.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprdfsP2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprdfsP3">An important feature of the protocol is that, although it may seem like one is trusting many random nodes not to decide to forget the file, one can reduce that risk down to near-zero by splitting the file into many pieces via secret sharing, and watching the contracts to see each piece is still in some node's possession.
    <br>If a contract is still paying out money, that provides a cryptographic proof that someone out there is still storing the file.

  <h4 id="idEthwprdaoH4">Decentralized-Autonomous-Organizations
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprdaoH4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idEthwprdaoP1">The general concept of a "decentralized autonomous organization" is that of <strong>a virtual entity</strong> that has a certain set of members or shareholders which, perhaps with a 67% majority, have the right to spend the entity's funds and modify its code.
    <br>The members would collectively decide on how the organization should allocate its funds.
    <br>Methods for allocating a DAO's funds could range from bounties, salaries to even more exotic mechanisms such as an internal currency to reward work.
    <br>This essentially replicates the legal trappings of a traditional company or nonprofit but using only cryptographic blockchain technology for enforcement.
    <br>So far much of the talk around DAOs has been around the "capitalist" model of a "decentralized autonomous corporation" (DAC) with dividend-receiving shareholders and tradable shares; an alternative, perhaps described as a "decentralized autonomous community", would have all members have an equal share in the decision making and require 67% of existing members to agree to add or remove a member.
    <br>The requirement that one person can only have one membership would then need to be enforced collectively by the group.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprdaoP1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprdaoP2">A general outline for how to code a DAO is as follows.
    <br>The simplest design is simply a piece of self-modifying code that changes if two thirds of members agree on a change.
    <br>Although code is theoretically immutable, one can easily get around this and have de-facto mutability by having chunks of the code in separate contracts, and having the address of which contracts to call stored in the modifiable storage.
    <br>In a simple implementation of such a DAO contract, there would be three transaction types, distinquished by the data provided in the transaction:
    <br>
    <br>* <code>[0,i,K,V]</code> to register a proposal with index <code>i</code> to change the address at storage index <code>K</code> to value <code>V</code>
    <br>* <code>[0,i]</code> to register a vote in favor of proposal <code>i</code>
    <br>* <code>[2,i]</code> to finalize proposal <code>i</code> if enough votes have been made
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprdaoP2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprdaoP3">The contract would then have clauses for each of these.
    <br>It would maintain a record of all open storage changes, along with a list of who voted for them.
    <br>It would also have a list of all members.
    <br>When any storage change gets to two thirds of members voting for it, a finalizing transaction could execute the change.
    <br>A more sophisticated skeleton would also have built-in voting ability for features like sending a transaction, adding members and removing members, and may even provide for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy">Liquid Democracy</a>-style vote delegation (ie. anyone can assign someone to vote for them, and assignment is transitive so if A assigns B and B assigns C then C determines A's vote).
    <br>This design would allow the DAO to grow organically as a decentralized community, allowing people to eventually delegate the task of filtering out who is a member to specialists, although unlike in the "current system" specialists can easily pop in and out of existence over time as individual community members change their alignments.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprdaoP3"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprdaoP4">An alternative model is for a decentralized corporation, where any account can have zero or more shares, and two thirds of the shares are required to make a decision.
    <br>A complete skeleton would involve asset management functionality, the ability to make an offer to buy or sell shares, and the ability to accept offers (preferably with an order-matching mechanism inside the contract).
    <br>Delegation would also exist Liquid Democracy-style, generalizing the concept of a "board of directors".

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprfappH4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idEthwprfappP1">1. <strong>Savings wallets</strong>.
    <br>Suppose that Alice wants to keep her funds safe, but is worried that she will lose or someone will hack her private key.
    <br>She puts ether into a contract with Bob, a bank, as follows:
    <br>
    <br>* Alice alone can withdraw a maximum of 1% of the funds per day.
    <br>* Bob alone can withdraw a maximum of 1% of the funds per day, but Alice has the ability to make a transaction with her key shutting off this ability.
    <br>* Alice and Bob together can withdraw anything.
    <br>
    <br>Normally, 1% per day is enough for Alice, and if Alice wants to withdraw more she can contact Bob for help.
    <br>If Alice's key gets hacked, she runs to Bob to move the funds to a new contract.
    <br>If she loses her key, Bob will get the funds out eventually.
    <br>If Bob turns out to be malicious, then she can turn off his ability to withdraw.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprfappP1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprfappP2">2. <strong>Crop insurance</strong>.
    <br>One can easily make a financial derivatives contract but using a data feed of the weather instead of any price index.
    <br>If a farmer in Iowa purchases a derivative that pays out inversely based on the precipitation in Iowa, then if there is a drought, the farmer will automatically receive money and if there is enough rain the farmer will be happy because their crops would do well.
    <br>This can be expanded to natural disaster insurance generally.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprfappP2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprfappP3">3. <strong>A decentralized data feed</strong>.
    <br>For financial contracts for difference, it may actually be possible to decentralize the data feed via a protocol called "<a href="http://blog.ethereum.org/2014/03/28/schellingcoin-a-minimal-trust-universal-data-feed/">SchellingCoin</a>".
    <br>SchellingCoin basically works as follows: N parties all put into the system the value of a given datum (eg. the ETH/USD price), the values are sorted, and everyone between the 25th and 75th percentile gets one token as a reward.
    <br>Everyone has the incentive to provide the answer that everyone else will provide, and the only value that a large number of players can realistically agree on is the obvious default: the truth.
    <br>This creates a decentralized protocol that can theoretically provide any number of values, including the ETH/USD price, the temperature in Berlin or even the result of a particular hard computation.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprfappP3"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprfappP4">4. <strong>Smart multisignature escrow</strong>.
    <br>Bitcoin allows multisignature transaction contracts where, for example, three out of a given five keys can spend the funds.
    <br>Ethereum allows for more granularity; for example, four out of five can spend everything, three out of five can spend up to 10% per day, and two out of five can spend up to 0.5% per day.
    <br>Additionally, Ethereum multisig is asynchronous - two parties can register their signatures on the blockchain at different times and the last signature will automatically send the transaction.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprfappP4"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprfappP5">5. <strong>Cloud computing</strong>.
    <br>The EVM technology can also be used to create a verifiable computing environment, allowing users to ask others to carry out computations and then optionally ask for proofs that computations at certain randomly selected checkpoints were done correctly.
    <br>This allows for the creation of a cloud computing market where any user can participate with their desktop, laptop or specialized server, and spot-checking together with security deposits can be used to ensure that the system is trustworthy (ie. nodes cannot profitably cheat).
    <br>Although such a system may not be suitable for all tasks; tasks that require a high level of inter-process communication, for example, cannot easily be done on a large cloud of nodes.
    <br>Other tasks, however, are much easier to parallelize; projects like SETI@home, folding@home and genetic algorithms can easily be implemented on top of such a platform.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprfappP5"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprfappP6">6. <strong>Peer-to-peer gambling</strong>.
    <br>Any number of peer-to-peer gambling protocols, such as Frank Stajano and Richard Clayton's <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fms27/papers/2008-StajanoCla-cyberdice.pdf">Cyberdice</a>, can be implemented on the Ethereum blockchain.
    <br>The simplest gambling protocol is actually simply a contract for difference on the next block hash, and more advanced protocols can be built up from there, creating gambling services with near-zero fees that have no ability to cheat.

  <section id="idEthwprghost">
  <h4 id="idEthwprghostH4">Modified-GHOST-Implementation
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprghostH4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idEthwprghostP1">The "Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree" (GHOST) protocol is an innovation first introduced by Yonatan Sompolinsky and Aviv Zohar in <a href="http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~avivz/pubs/13/btc_scalability_full.pdf">December 2013</a>.
    <br>The motivation behind GHOST is that blockchains with fast confirmation times currently suffer from reduced security due to a high stale rate - because blocks take a certain time to propagate through the network, if miner A mines a block and then miner B happens to mine another block before miner A's block propagates to B, miner B's block will end up wasted and will not contribute to network security.
    <br>Furthermore, there is a centralization issue: if miner A is a mining pool with 30% hashpower and B has 10% hashpower, A will have a risk of producing a stale block 70% of the time (since the other 30% of the time A produced the last block and so will get mining data immediately) whereas B will have a risk of producing a stale block 90% of the time.
    <br>Thus, if the block interval is short enough for the stale rate to be high, A will be substantially more efficient simply by virtue of its size.
    <br>With these two effects combined, blockchains which produce blocks quickly are very likely to lead to one mining pool having a large enough percentage of the network hashpower to have de facto control over the mining process.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprghostP1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprghostP2">As described by Sompolinsky and Zohar, GHOST solves the first issue of network security loss by including stale blocks in the calculation of which chain is the "longest"; that is to say, not just the parent and further ancestors of a block, but also the stale descendants of the block's ancestor (in Ethereum jargon, "uncles") are added to the calculation of which block has the largest total proof of work backing it.
    <br>To solve the second issue of centralization bias, we go beyond the protocol described by Sompolinsky and Zohar, and also provide block rewards to stales: a stale block receives 87.5% of its base reward, and the nephew that includes the stale block receives the remaining 12.5%.
    <br>Transaction fees, however, are not awarded to uncles.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprghostP2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprghostP3">Ethereum implements a simplified version of GHOST which only goes down seven levels.
    <br>Specifically, it is defined as follows:
    <br>
    <br>* A block must specify a parent, and it must specify 0 or more uncles
    <br>* An uncle included in block B must have the following properties:
    <br> &nbsp;o It must be a direct child of the kth generation ancestor of B, where 2 &lt;= k &lt;= 7.
    <br> &nbsp;o It cannot be an ancestor of B
    <br> &nbsp;o An uncle must be a valid block header, but does not need to be a previously verified or even valid block
    <br> &nbsp;o An uncle must be different from all uncles included in previous blocks and all other uncles included in the same block (non-double-inclusion)
    <br>* For every uncle U in block B, the miner of B gets an additional 3.125% added to its coinbase reward and the miner of U gets 93.75% of a standard coinbase reward.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprghostP3"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprghostP4">This limited version of GHOST, with uncles includable only up to 7 generations, was used for two reasons.
    <br>First, unlimited GHOST would include too many complications into the calculation of which uncles for a given block are valid.
    <br>Second, unlimited GHOST with compensation as used in Ethereum removes the incentive for a miner to mine on the main chain and not the chain of a public attacker.

  <section id="idEthwprfee">
  <h4 id="idEthwprfeeH4">Fees
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprfeeH4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idEthwprfeeP1">Because every transaction published into the blockchain imposes on the network the cost of needing to download and verify it, there is a need for some regulatory mechanism, typically involving transaction fees, to prevent abuse.
    <br>The default approach, used in Bitcoin, is to have purely voluntary fees, relying on miners to act as the gatekeepers and set dynamic minimums.
    <br>This approach has been received very favorably in the Bitcoin community particularly because it is "market-based", allowing supply and demand between miners and transaction senders determine the price.
    <br>The problem with this line of reasoning is, however, that transaction processing is not a market; although it is intuitively attractive to construe transaction processing as a service that the miner is offering to the sender, in reality every transaction that a miner includes will need to be processed by every node in the network, so the vast majority of the cost of transaction processing is borne by third parties and not the miner that is making the decision of whether or not to include it.
    <br>Hence, tragedy-of-the-commons problems are very likely to occur.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprfeeP1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprfeeP2">However, as it turns out this flaw in the market-based mechanism, when given a particular inaccurate simplifying assumption, magically cancels itself out.
    <br>The argument is as follows.
    <br>Suppose that:
    <br>
    <br>1. A transaction leads to <code>k</code> operations, offering the reward <code>kR</code> to any miner that includes it where <code>R</code> is set by the sender and <code>k</code> and <code>R</code> are (roughly) visible to the miner beforehand.
    <br>2. An operation has a processing cost of <code>C</code> to any node (ie. all nodes have equal efficiency)
    <br>3. There are <code>N</code> mining nodes, each with exactly equal processing power (ie. <code>1/N</code> of total)
    <br>4. No non-mining full nodes exist.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprfeeP2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprfeeP3">A miner would be willing to process a transaction if the expected reward is greater than the cost.
    <br>Thus, the expected reward is <code>kR/N</code> since the miner has a <code>1/N</code> chance of processing the next block, and the processing cost for the miner is simply <code>kC</code>.
    <br>Hence, miners will include transactions where <code>kR/N > kC</code>, or <code>R > NC</code>.
    <br>Note that <code>R</code> is the per-operation fee provided by the sender, and is thus a lower bound on the benefit that the sender derives from the transaction, and <code>NC</code> is the cost to the entire network together of processing an operation.
    <br>Hence, miners have the incentive to include only those transactions for which the total utilitarian benefit exceeds the cost.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprfeeP3"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprfeeP4">However, there are several important deviations from those assumptions in reality:
    <br>
    <br>1. The miner does pay a higher cost to process the transaction than the other verifying nodes, since the extra verification time delays block propagation and thus increases the chance the block will become a stale.
    <br>2. There do exist nonmining full nodes.
    <br>3. The mining power distribution may end up radically inegalitarian in practice.
    <br>4. Speculators, political enemies and crazies whose utility function includes causing harm to the network do exist, and they can cleverly set up contracts where their cost is much lower than the cost paid by other verifying nodes.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprfeeP4"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprfeeP5">(1) provides a tendency for the miner to include fewer transactions, and (2) increases <code>NC</code>; hence, these two effects at least partially cancel each other out.
    <br>(3) and (4) are the major issue; to solve them we simply institute a floating cap: no block can have more operations than <code>BLK_LIMIT_FACTOR</code> times the long-term exponential moving average.
    <br>Specifically:
    <br>
    <br><code>blk.oplimit = floor((blk.parent.oplimit * (EMA_FACTOR - 1) + floor(parent.opcount * BLK_LIMIT_FACTOR)) / EMA_FACTOR)</code>
    <br>
    <br><code>BLK_LIMIT_FACTOR</code> and <code>EMA_FACTOR</code> are constants that will be set to 65536 and 1.5 for the time being, but will likely be changed after further analysis.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprfeeP5"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprfeeP6">There is another factor disincentivizing large block sizes in Bitcoin: blocks that are large will take longer to propagate, and thus have a higher probability of becoming stales.
    <br>In Ethereum, highly gas-consuming blocks can also take longer to propagate both because they are physically larger and because they take longer to process the transaction state transitions to validate.
    <br>This delay disincentive is a significant consideration in Bitcoin, but less so in Ethereum because of the GHOST protocol; hence, relying on regulated block limits provides a more stable baseline.

  <section id="idEthwprcatc">
  <h4 id="idEthwprcatcH4">Computation-And-Turing-Completeness
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprcatcH4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idEthwprcatcP1">An important note is that the Ethereum virtual machine is Turing-complete; this means that EVM code can encode any computation that can be conceivably carried out, including infinite loops.
    <br>EVM code allows looping in two ways.
    <br>First, there is a <code>JUMP</code> instruction that allows the program to jump back to a previous spot in the code, and a <code>JUMPI</code> instruction to do conditional jumping, allowing for statements like <code>while x &lt; 27: x = x * 2</code>.
    <br>Second, contracts can call other contracts, potentially allowing for looping through recursion.
    <br>This naturally leads to a problem: can malicious users essentially shut miners and full nodes down by forcing them to enter into an infinite loop?
    <br>The issue arises because of a problem in computer science known as the halting problem: there is no way to tell, in the general case, whether or not a given program will ever halt.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprcatcP1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprcatcP2">As described in the state transition section, our solution works by requiring a transaction to set a maximum number of computational steps that it is allowed to take, and if execution takes longer computation is reverted but fees are still paid.
    <br>Messages work in the same way.
    <br>To show the motivation behind our solution, consider the following examples:
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprcatcP2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprcatcP3">* An attacker creates a contract which runs an infinite loop, and then sends a transaction activating that loop to the miner.
    <br>The miner will process the transaction, running the infinite loop, and wait for it to run out of gas.
    <br>Even though the execution runs out of gas and stops halfway through, the transaction is still valid and the miner still claims the fee from the attacker for each computational step.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprcatcP3"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprcatcP4">* An attacker creates a very long infinite loop with the intent of forcing the miner to keep computing for such a long time that by the time computation finishes a few more blocks will have come out and it will not be possible for the miner to include the transaction to claim the fee.
    <br>However, the attacker will be required to submit a value for <code>STARTGAS</code> limiting the number of computational steps that execution can take, so the miner will know ahead of time that the computation will take an excessively large number of steps.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprcatcP4"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprcatcP5">* An attacker sees a contract with code of some form like <code>send(A,contract.storage[A]); contract.storage[A] = 0</code>, and sends a transaction with just enough gas to run the first step but not the second (ie. making a withdrawal but not letting the balance go down).
    <br>The contract author does not need to worry about protecting against such attacks, because if execution stops halfway through the changes get reverted.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprcatcP5"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprcatcP6">* A financial contract works by taking the median of nine proprietary data feeds in order to minimize risk.
    <br>An attacker takes over one of the data feeds, which is designed to be modifiable via the variable-address-call mechanism described in the section on DAOs, and converts it to run an infinite loop, thereby attempting to force any attempts to claim funds from the financial contract to run out of gas.
    <br>However, the financial contract can set a gas limit on the message to prevent this problem.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprcatcP6"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprcatcP7">The alternative to Turing-completeness is Turing-incompleteness, where <code>JUMP</code> and <code>JUMPI</code> do not exist and only one copy of each contract is allowed to exist in the call stack at any given time.
    <br>With this system, the fee system described and the uncertainties around the effectiveness of our solution might not be necessary, as the cost of executing a contract would be bounded above by its size.
    <br>Additionally, Turing-incompleteness is not even that big a limitation; out of all the contract examples we have conceived internally, so far only one required a loop, and even that loop could be removed by making 26 repetitions of a one-line piece of code.
    <br>Given the serious implications of Turing-completeness, and the limited benefit, why not simply have a Turing-incomplete language?
    <br>In reality, however, Turing-incompleteness is far from a neat solution to the problem.
    <br>To see why, consider the following contracts:
    <br><code>
    <br>    C0: call(C1); call(C1);
    <br>    C1: call(C2); call(C2);
    <br>    C2: call(C3); call(C3);
    <br>    ...
    <br>    C49: call(C50); call(C50);
    <br>    C50: (run one step of a program and record the change in storage)</code>
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprcatcP7"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprcatcP8">Now, send a transaction to A.
    <br>Thus, in 51 transactions, we have a contract that takes up 2<sup>50</sup> computational steps.
    <br>Miners could try to detect such logic bombs ahead of time by maintaining a value alongside each contract specifying the maximum number of computational steps that it can take, and calculating this for contracts calling other contracts recursively, but that would require miners to forbid contracts that create other contracts (since the creation and execution of all 26 contracts above could easily be rolled into a single contract).
    <br>Another problematic point is that the address field of a message is a variable, so in general it may not even be possible to tell which other contracts a given contract will call ahead of time.
    <br>Hence, all in all, we have a surprising conclusion: Turing-completeness is surprisingly easy to manage, and the lack of Turing-completeness is equally surprisingly difficult to manage unless the exact same controls are in place - but in that case why not just let the protocol be Turing-complete?

  <h4 id="idEthwprcaiH4">Currency-And-Issuance
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprcaiH4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idEthwprcaiP1">The Ethereum network includes its own built-in currency, ether, which serves the dual purpose of providing a primary liquidity layer to allow for efficient exchange between various types of digital assets and, more importantly, of providing a mechanism for paying transaction fees. For convenience and to avoid future argument (see the current mBTC/uBTC/satoshi debate in Bitcoin), the denominations will be pre-labeled:
    <br>
    <br>* 1: wei
    <br>* 10<sup>12</sup>: szabo
    <br>* 10<sup>15</sup>: finney
    <br>* 10<sup>18</sup>: ether
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprcaiP1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprcaiP2">This should be taken as an expanded version of the concept of "dollars" and "cents" or "BTC" and "satoshi". In the near future, we expect "ether" to be used for ordinary transactions, "finney" for microtransactions and "szabo" and "wei" for technical discussions around fees and protocol implementation; the remaining denominations may become useful later and should not be included in clients at this point.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprcaiP2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprcaiP3">The issuance model will be as follows:
    <br>
    <br>* Ether will be released in a currency sale at the price of 1000-2000 ether per BTC, a mechanism intended to fund the Ethereum organization and pay for development that has been used with success by other platforms such as Mastercoin and NXT. Earlier buyers will benefit from larger discounts. The BTC received from the sale will be used entirely to pay salaries and bounties to developers and invested into various for-profit and non-profit projects in the Ethereum and cryptocurrency ecosystem.
    <br>* 0.099x the total amount sold (60102216 ETH) will be allocated to the organization to compensate early contributors and pay ETH-denominated expenses before the genesis block.
    <br>* 0.099x the total amount sold will be maintained as a long-term reserve.
    <br>* 0.26x the total amount sold will be allocated to miners per year forever after that point.

  <p id="idEthwprcaiP5"><strong>Long-Term Supply Growth Rate (percent)</strong>:
    <br>
    <br><img src="filMcsDtcnet.files/imgEthwprFig7.png">
    <br>Despite the linear currency issuance, just like with Bitcoin over time the supply growth rate nevertheless tends to zero
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprcaiP5"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprcaiP6">The two main choices in the above model are (1) the existence and size of an endowment pool, and (2) the existence of a permanently growing linear supply, as opposed to a capped supply as in Bitcoin.
    <br>The justification of the endowment pool is as follows.
    <br>If the endowment pool did not exist, and the linear issuance reduced to 0.217x to provide the same inflation rate, then the total quantity of ether would be 16.5% less and so each unit would be 19.8% more valuable.
    <br>Hence, in the equilibrium 19.8% more ether would be purchased in the sale, so each unit would once again be exactly as valuable as before.
    <br>The organization would also then have 1.198x as much BTC, which can be considered to be split into two slices: the original BTC, and the additional 0.198x.
    <br>Hence, this situation is <em>exactly equivalent</em> to the endowment, but with one important difference: the organization holds purely BTC, and so is not incentivized to support the value of the ether unit.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprcaiP6"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprcaiP7">The permanent linear supply growth model reduces the risk of what some see as excessive wealth concentration in Bitcoin, and gives individuals living in present and future eras a fair chance to acquire currency units, while at the same time retaining a strong incentive to obtain and hold ether because the "supply growth rate" as a percentage still tends to zero over time.
    <br>We also theorize that because coins are always lost over time due to carelessness, death, etc, and coin loss can be modeled as a percentage of the total supply per year, that the total currency supply in circulation will in fact eventually stabilize at a value equal to the annual issuance divided by the loss rate (eg. at a loss rate of 1%, once the supply reaches 26X then 0.26X will be mined and 0.26X lost every year, creating an equilibrium).
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprcaiP7"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprcaiP8">Note that in the future, it is likely that Ethereum will switch to a proof-of-stake model for security, reducing the issuance requirement to somewhere between zero and 0.05X per year.
    <br>In the event that the Ethereum organization loses funding or for any other reason disappears, we leave open a "social contract": anyone has the right to create a future candidate version of Ethereum, with the only condition being that the quantity of ether must be at most equal to <code>60102216 * (1.198 + 0.26 * n)</code> where <code>n</code> is the number of years after the genesis block.
    <br>Creators are free to crowd-sell or otherwise assign some or all of the difference between the PoS-driven supply expansion and the maximum allowable supply expansion to pay for development.
    <br>Candidate upgrades that do not comply with the social contract may justifiably be forked into compliant versions.

  <h4 id="idEthwprmngcH4">Mining-Centralization
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprmngcH4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idEthwprmngcP1">The Bitcoin mining algorithm works by having miners compute SHA256 on slightly modified versions of the block header millions of times over and over again, until eventually one node comes up with a version whose hash is less than the target (currently around 2<sup>192</sup>).
    <br>However, this mining algorithm is vulnerable to two forms of centralization.
    <br>First, the mining ecosystem has come to be dominated by ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), computer chips designed for, and therefore thousands of times more efficient at, the specific task of Bitcoin mining.
    <br>This means that Bitcoin mining is no longer a highly decentralized and egalitarian pursuit, requiring millions of dollars of capital to effectively participate in.
    <br>Second, most Bitcoin miners do not actually perform block validation locally; instead, they rely on a centralized mining pool to provide the block headers.
    <br>This problem is arguably worse: as of the time of this writing, the top three mining pools indirectly control roughly 50% of processing power in the Bitcoin network, although this is mitigated by the fact that miners can switch to other mining pools if a pool or coalition attempts a 51% attack.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprmngcP1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprmngcP2">The current intent at Ethereum is to use a mining algorithm where miners are required to fetch random data from the state, compute some randomly selected transactions from the last N blocks in the blockchain, and return the hash of the result.
    <br>This has two important benefits.
    <br>First, Ethereum contracts can include any kind of computation, so an Ethereum ASIC would essentially be an ASIC for general computation - ie. a better CPU.
    <br>Second, mining requires access to the entire blockchain, forcing miners to store the entire blockchain and at least be capable of verifying every transaction.
    <br>This removes the need for centralized mining pools; although mining pools can still serve the legitimate role of evening out the randomness of reward distribution, this function can be served equally well by peer-to-peer pools with no central control.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprmngcP2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprmngcP3">This model is untested, and there may be difficulties along the way in avoiding certain clever optimizations when using contract execution as a mining algorithm.
    <br>However, one notably interesting feature of this algorithm is that it allows anyone to "poison the well", by introducing a large number of contracts into the blockchain specifically designed to stymie certain ASICs.
    <br>The economic incentives exist for ASIC manufacturers to use such a trick to attack each other.
    <br>Thus, the solution that we are developing is ultimately an adaptive economic human solution rather than purely a technical one.

  <h4 id="idEthwprscbtH4">Scalability
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprscbtH4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idEthwprscbtP1">One common concern about Ethereum is the issue of scalability.
    <br>Like Bitcoin, Ethereum suffers from the flaw that every transaction needs to be processed by every node in the network.
    <br>With Bitcoin, the size of the current blockchain rests at about 15 GB, growing by about 1 MB per hour.
    <br>If the Bitcoin network were to process Visa's 2000 transactions per second, it would grow by 1 MB per three seconds (1 GB per hour, 8 TB per year).
    <br>Ethereum is likely to suffer a similar growth pattern, worsened by the fact that there will be many applications on top of the Ethereum blockchain instead of just a currency as is the case with Bitcoin, but ameliorated by the fact that Ethereum full nodes need to store just the state instead of the entire blockchain history.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprscbtP1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprscbtP2">The problem with such a large blockchain size is centralization risk.
    <br>If the blockchain size increases to, say, 100 TB, then the likely scenario would be that only a very small number of large businesses would run full nodes, with all regular users using light SPV nodes.
    <br>In such a situation, there arises the potential concern that the full nodes could band together and all agree to cheat in some profitable fashion (eg. change the block reward, give themselves BTC).
    <br>Light nodes would have no way of detecting this immediately.
    <br>Of course, at least one honest full node would likely exist, and after a few hours information about the fraud would trickle out through channels like Reddit, but at that point it would be too late: it would be up to the ordinary users to organize an effort to blacklist the given blocks, a massive and likely infeasible coordination problem on a similar scale as that of pulling off a successful 51% attack.
    <br>In the case of Bitcoin, this is currently a problem, but there exists a blockchain modification <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140623061815/http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/31709140/">suggested by Peter Todd</a> which will alleviate this issue.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprscbtP2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprscbtP3">In the near term, Ethereum will use two additional strategies to cope with this problem.
    <br>First, because of the blockchain-based mining algorithms, at least every miner will be forced to be a full node, creating a lower bound on the number of full nodes.
    <br>Second and more importantly, however, we will include an intermediate state tree root in the blockchain after processing each transaction.
    <br>Even if block validation is centralized, as long as one honest verifying node exists, the centralization problem can be circumvented via a verification protocol.
    <br>If a miner publishes an invalid block, that block must either be badly formatted, or the state <code>S[n]</code> is incorrect.
    <br>Since <code>S[0]</code> is known to be correct, there must be some first state <code>S[i]</code> that is incorrect where <code>S[i-1]</code> is correct.
    <br>The verifying node would provide the index <code>i</code>, along with a "proof of invalidity" consisting of the subset of Patricia tree nodes needing to process <code>APPLY(S[i-1],TX[i]) -> S[i]</code>.
    <br>Nodes would be able to use those nodes to run that part of the computation, and see that the <code>S[i]</code> generated does not match the <code>S[i]</code> provided.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprscbtP3"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprscbtP4">Another, more sophisticated, attack would involve the malicious miners publishing incomplete blocks, so the full information does not even exist to determine whether or not blocks are valid.
    <br>The solution to this is a challenge-response protocol: verification nodes issue "challenges" in the form of target transaction indices, and upon receiving a node a light node treats the block as untrusted until another node, whether the miner or another verifier, provides a subset of Patricia nodes as a proof of validity.

  <h3 id="idEthwprclnH3">Conclusion
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprclnH3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idEthwprclnP1">The Ethereum protocol was originally conceived as an upgraded version of a cryptocurrency, providing advanced features such as on-blockchain escrow, withdrawal limits, financial contracts, gambling markets and the like via a highly generalized programming language.
    <br>The Ethereum protocol would not "support" any of the applications directly, but the existence of a Turing-complete programming language means that arbitrary contracts can theoretically be created for any transaction type or application.
    <br>What is more interesting about Ethereum, however, is that the Ethereum protocol moves far beyond just currency.
    <br>Protocols around decentralized file storage, decentralized computation and decentralized prediction markets, among dozens of other such concepts, have the potential to substantially increase the efficiency of the computational industry, and provide a massive boost to other peer-to-peer protocols by adding for the first time an economic layer.
    <br>Finally, there is also a substantial array of applications that have nothing to do with money at all.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthwprclnP1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthwprclnP2">The concept of an arbitrary state transition function as implemented by the Ethereum protocol provides for a platform with unique potential; rather than being a closed-ended, single-purpose protocol intended for a specific array of applications in data storage, gambling or finance, Ethereum is open-ended by design, and we believe that it is extremely well-suited to serving as a foundational layer for a very large number of both financial and non-financial protocols in the years to come.

    <br>However, it is in fact perfectly legitimate cryptographic terminology to refer to the pubkey hash as a public key itself.
    <br>This is because Bitcoin's cryptography can be considered to be a custom digital signature algorithm, where the public key consists of the hash of the ECC pubkey, the signature consists of the ECC pubkey concatenated with the ECC signature, and the verification algorithm involves checking the ECC pubkey in the signature against the ECC pubkey hash provided as a public key and then verifying the ECC signature against the ECC pubkey.

    <br>[<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Whisper">https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Whisper</a>]
    <br>===
    <br>Whisper is a part of the Ethereum P2P protocol suite that allows for messaging between users via the same network that the blockchain runs on.
    <br>
    <br>There are many uses, some of which are listed on the wiki
    <br>
    <br>The protocol is seperate from the blockchain, so smart contracts do not have access.
    <br>
    <br>Whisper has existed in a sort of alpha, working-prototype state for some time now. It can be enabled by using the -shh flag in geth, but nodes do not relay the messages by default, so chances are that messages won't get through unless you are directly connected to the recipient. API documentation can be found on github.

  <p id="idEthnodMnrdsn">Description::
    <br>Miner. A node on the network that mines, i.e., works to process blocks on the blockchain. You can see a partial list of live Ethereum miners here: stats.ethdev.com.
    <br>[<a href="https://medium.com/@ConsenSys/a-101-noob-intro-to-programming-smart-contracts-on-ethereum-695d15c1dab4#.5x9da12dp">https://medium.com/@ConsenSys/a-101-noob-intro-to-programming-smart-contracts-on-ethereum-695d15c1dab4#.5x9da12dp</a>]
    <br>===
    <br>These transaction fees are collected by the nodes that validate the network. These “miners” are nodes in the Ethereum network that receive, propogate, verify, and execute transactions. The miners then group the transactions – which include many updates to the “state” of accounts in the Ethereum blockchain – into what are called “blocks”, and miners then compete with one another for their block to be the next one to be added to the blockchain. Miners are rewarded with ether for each successful block they mine. This provides the economic incentive for people to dedicate hardware and electricity to the Ethereum network.
    <br>...
    <br>Just as in the Bitcoin network, miners are tasked with solving a complex mathematical problem in order to successfully “mine” a block. This is known as a “Proof of Work”. Any computational problem that requires orders of magnitude more resources to solve algorithmically than it takes to verify the solution is a good candidate for proof of work. In order to discourage centralisation due to the use of specialised hardware (e.g. ASICs), as has occurred in the Bitcoin network, Ethereum chose a memory-hard computational problem. If the problem requires memory as well as CPU, the ideal hardware is in fact the general computer. This makes Ethereum’s Proof of Work ASIC-resistant, allowing a more decentralized distribution of security than blockchains whose mining is dominated by specialized hardware, like Bitcoin.

    <br>The Ethereum network is kept running by computers all over the world.
    <br>In order to reward the computational costs of both processing the contracts and securing the network, there is a reward that is given to the computer that was able to create the latest block on the chain.
    <br>Every 12 seconds, on average, a new block is added to the blockchain with the latest transactions processed by the network and the computer that generated this block will be awarded 5 ether.
    <br>Due to the nature of the algorithm for block generation, this process (generating a proof of work) is guaranteed to be random and rewards are given in proportion to the computational power of each machine.
    <br>This process is usually called mining in the crypto-currency lingo.

    <br>Blockchain technology is the technological basis of Bitcoin, first described by its mysterious author <a class="clsPreview" href="FilMcsDbcnetBtc.Last.html#idBtchmnSnt">Satoshi Nakamoto</a> in his white paper “<a class="clsPreview" href="FilMcsDbcnetBtc.Last.html#idBtcwpr">Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System</a>”, published in 2008. While the use of blockchains for more general uses was already discussed in the original paper, it was not until a few years later that blockchain technology emerged as a generic term. A blockchain is a distributed computing architecture where every network node executes and records the same transactions, which are grouped into blocks. Only one block can be added at a time, and every block contains a mathematical proof that verifies that it follows in sequence from the previous block. In this way, the blockchain’s “distributed database” is kept in consensus across the whole network. Individual user interactions with the ledger (transactions) are secured by strong cryptography. Nodes that maintain and verify the network are incentivized by mathematically enforced economic incentives coded into the protocol.

Someone reading the proof can verify that the hashing, at least for that branch, is consistent going all the way up the tree, and therefore that the given chunk actually is at that position in the tree. The application is simple: suppose that there is a large database, and that the entire contents of the database are stored in a Merkle tree where the root of the Merkle tree is publicly known and trusted (eg. it was digitally signed by enough trusted parties, or there is a lot of proof of work on it). Then, a user who wants to do a key-value lookup on the database (eg. “tell me the object in position 85273”) can ask for a Merkle proof, and upon receiving the proof verify that it is correct, and therefore that the value received actually is at position 85273 in the database with that particular root. It allows a mechanism for authenticating a small amount of data, like a hash, to be extended to also authenticate large databases of potentially unbounded size.

    <br>The original application of Merkle proofs was in Bitcoin, as described and created by <a class="clsPreview" href="FilMcsDbcnetBtc.Last.html#idBtchmnSnt">Satoshi Nakamoto</a> in 2009. The Bitcoin blockchain uses Merkle proofs in order to store the transactions in every block:
    <br>
    <br>The benefit that this provides is the concept that Satoshi described as “simplified payment verification”: instead of downloading every transaction and every block, a “light client” can only download the chain of block headers, 80-byte chunks of data for each block that contain only five things:
    <br>A hash of the previous header
    <br>A timestamp
    <br>A mining difficulty value
    <br>A proof of work nonce
    <br>A root hash for the Merkle tree containing the transactions for that block.

    <br>1. Check if the previous block referenced exists and is valid.
    <br>2. Check that the timestamp of the block is greater than that of the referenced previous block and less than 15 minutes into the future
    <br>3. Check that the block number, difficulty, transaction root, uncle root and gas limit (various low-level  Ethereum-specific concepts) are valid.
    <br>4. Check that the proof of work on the block is valid.
    <br>5. Let S[0] be the state at the end of the previous block.
    <br>6. Let TX be the block's transaction list, with n transactions. For all i in 0...n-1, set S[i+1] = APPLY(S[i],TX[i]). If any application returns an error, or if the total gas consumed in the block up until this point exceeds the GASLIMIT, return an error.

    <br>Fortunately, the next version of the Ethereum testnet, Kovan, has been announced by the Parity community. Although this new testnet is incompatible with geth nodes, it uses the PoA (Proof of Authority) consensus, which should improve its resilience to spam attacks. ChronoBank has also made an application to become a trusted validator for the new testnet.
    <br>PoA is a replacement for PoW and can be used for both public and private chain setups. There is no mining involved to secure the network with PoA. Instead, it relies on trusted ‘Validators’ to ensure that legitimate transactions are added to blocks, and are processed and executed by the EVM faithfully.
    <br>Because mining does not occur on our proposed public testnet, malicious actors are prevented from acquiring testnet Ether -- solving the spam attack that Ropsten currently faces. There is no difference in the way that contracts are executed on PoA and PoW chains, so developers can test their contracts and user interfaces before deploying to the mainnet in a more reliable and convenient environment.

  <p id="idEthtxdsn">Description::
    <br><strong>Transactions fundamentally change <span class="clsU">the state</span> of the network</strong>.
    <br>A transaction can be
    <br>- as simple as sending Ether to another account, or
    <br>- as complicated as executing a contract function or
    <br>- adding a new contract to the network.
    <br><strong>The defining characteristic of a transaction is that it writes (or changes) data</strong>.
    <br>Transactions cost Ether to run, known as "gas", and transactions take time to process.
    <br>When you execute a contract's function via a transaction, you cannot receive that function's return value because the transaction isn't processed immediately.
    <br>In general, functions meant to be executed via a transaction will not return a value; they will return a transaction id instead.
    <br>So in summary, transactions:
    <br>- Cost gas (Ether)
    <br>- Change the state of the network
    <br>- Aren't processed immediately
    <br>- Won't expose a return value (only a transaction id).

    <br>Transactions contain:

    <br>===
    <br>A transaction is a message that is sent from one account to another account (which might be the same or the special zero-account, see below). It can include binary data (its payload) and Ether.
    <br>
    <br>If the target account contains code, that code is executed and the payload is provided as input data.
    <br>
    <br>If the target account is the zero-account (the account with the address 0), the transaction creates a new contract. As already mentioned, the address of that contract is not the zero address but an address derived from the sender and its number of transactions sent (the “nonce”). The payload of such a contract creation transaction is taken to be EVM bytecode and executed. The output of this execution is permanently stored as the code of the contract. This means that in order to create a contract, you do not send the actual code of the contract, but in fact code that returns that code.

    <br>===
    <br>A blockchain is a globally shared, transactional database.
    <br>This means that everyone can read entries in the database just by participating in the network.
    <br>If you want to change something in the database, you have to create a so-called transaction which has to be accepted by all others.
    <br>The word transaction implies that the change you want to make (assume you want to change two values at the same time) is either not done at all or completely applied.
    <br>Furthermore, while your transaction is applied to the database, no other transaction can alter it.
    <br>
    <br>As an example, imagine a table that lists the balances of all accounts in an electronic currency. If a transfer from one account to another is requested, the transactional nature of the database ensures that if the amount is subtracted from one account, it is always added to the other account. If due to whatever reason, adding the amount to the target account is not possible, the source account is also not modified.
    <br>
    <br>Furthermore, <strong>a transaction is always cryptographically signed by the sender (creator)</strong>. This makes it straightforward to guard access to specific modifications of the database. In the example of the electronic currency, a simple check ensures that only the person holding the keys to the account can transfer money from it.

    <br>The term “transaction” is used in Ethereum to refer to the signed data package that stores a message to be sent from an externally owned account to another account on the blockchain.
    <br>Transactions contain:
    <br>the recipient of the message,
    <br>a signature identifying the sender and proving their intention to send the message to the blockchain to the reciptient,
    <br>VALUE field - The amount of wei to transfer from the sender to the recipient,
    <br>an optional data field, which can contain the message sent to a contract,
    <br>a STARTGAS value, representing the maximum number of computational steps the transaction execution is allowed to take,
    <br>a GASPRICE value, representing the fee the sender is willing to pay for gas. One unit of gas corresponds to the execution of one atomic instrucion, i.e., a computational step.

    <br>===
    <br>An Ethereum transaction contract code can trigger data reads and writes, do expensive computations like using cryptographic primitives, make calls (send messages) to other contracts, etc. Each of these operations have a cost measured in gas, and each gas unit consumed by a transaction must be paid for in Ether, based on a gas/Ether price which changes dynamically.
    <br><strong>This price is deducted from the Ethereum account sending the transaction</strong>.
    <br>Transactions also have a gas limit parameter that is an upper bound on how much gas the transaction can consume, and is used as a safe-guard against programming errors that could deplete an account’s funds.

    <br>===
    <br>Fees applied to transaction go to support the networks that run the coin/token - so, for instance, every <span class="clsU">standard (non-contract) ETH transaction</span> currently applies a fee of .000441 ETH.
    <br>This fee does not go to us; it goes to reward miners (thereby ensuring that the transaction is logged into the blockchain in a timely fashion) and support the Ethereum network itself.
    <br>Note that transactions that interact with a contract address will be more costly.

    <br>===
    <br>Like in Bitcoin, users must pay small transaction fees to the network. This protects the Ethereum blockchain from frivolous or malicious computational tasks, like DDoS attacks or infinite loops. The sender of a transaction must pay for each step of the “program” they activated, including computation and memory storage. These fees are paid in amounts of Ethereum’s native value-token, ether.

  <p id="idEthtxCacdsn">Description::
    <br>If the target account is the zero-account (the account with the address 0), the transaction creates a new contract.
    <br>As already mentioned, the address of that contract is not the zero address but an address derived from the sender and its number of transactions sent (the “nonce”).
    <br>The payload of such a contract creation transaction is taken to be EVM bytecode and executed.
    <br>The output of this execution is permanently stored as the code of the contract.
    <br>This means that in order to create a contract, you do not send the actual code of the contract, but in fact code that returns that code.
    <br>[<a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.9/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#index-8">https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.9/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#index-8</a>]
    <br>===
    <br><span class="clsU">A contract creating transaction</span> looks like a standard transaction, except the receiving address is blank. When a contract creating transaction makes its way into the blockchain, the data bytearray in the transaction is interpreted as EVM code, and the value returned by that EVM execution is taken to be the code of the new contract; hence, you can have a transaction do certain things during initialization. The address of the new contract is deterministically calculated based on the sending address and the number of times that the sending account has made a transaction before (this value, called the account nonce, is also kept for unrelated security reasons). Thus, the full code that you need to put onto the blockchain to produce the above name registry is as follows:
    <br>PUSH1 16 DUP PUSH1 12 PUSH1 0 CODECOPY PUSH1 0 RETURN STOP PUSH1 0 CALLDATALOAD SLOAD NOT PUSH1 9 JUMPI STOP PUSH1 32 CALLDATALOAD PUSH1 0 CALLDATALOAD SSTORE
    <br>The key opcodes are CODECOPY, copying the 16 bytes of code starting from byte 12 into memory starting at index 0, and RETURN, returning memory bytes 0-16, ie. code byes 12-28 (feel free to "run" the execution manually on paper to verify that those parts of the code and memory actually get copied and returned). Code bytes 12-28 are, of course, the actual code as we saw above.

    <br><strong>Public blockchains</strong>: a public blockchain is a blockchain that anyone in the world can read, anyone in the world can send transactions to and expect to see them included if they are valid, and anyone in the world can participate in the consensus process – the process for determining what blocks get added to the chain and what the current state is. As a substitute for centralized or quasi-centralized trust, public blockchains are secured by cryptoeconomics – the combination of economic incentives and cryptographic verification using mechanisms such as proof of work or proof of stake, following a general principle that the degree to which someone can have an influence in the consensus process is proportional to the quantity of economic resources that they can bring to bear. These blockchains are generally considered to be “fully decentralized”.
    <br><strong>Consortium blockchains</strong>: a consortium blockchain is a blockchain where the consensus process is controlled by a pre-selected set of nodes; for example, one might imagine a consortium of 15 financial institutions, each of which operates a node and of which 10 must sign every block in order for the block to be valid. The right to read the blockchain may be public, or restricted to the participants, and there are also hybrid routes such as the root hashes of the blocks being public together with an API that allows members of the public to make a limited number of queries and get back cryptographic proofs of some parts of the blockchain state. These blockchains may be considered “partially decentralized”.
    <br><strong>Private blockchains</strong>: a fully private blockchain is a blockchain where write permissions are kept centralized to one organization. Read permissions may be public or restricted to an arbitrary extent. Likely applications include database management, auditing, etc internal to a single company, and so public readability may not be necessary in many cases at all, though in other cases public auditability is desired.

    <br>Whereas the Bitcoin blockchain was purely a list of transactions, <strong>Ethereum’s basic unit is the account</strong>. The Ethereum blockchain tracks <strong>the state</strong> of every account, and all <span class="clsU">state transitions</span> on the Ethereum blockchain are transfers of <span class="clsU">value and information</span> between accounts.

    <br>===
    <br>There are two types of accounts on the Ethereum blockchain.
    <br>- Accounts that have a private key.
    <br>- Contracts (which do not have a private key)
    <br>Private key accounts are the accounts that humans operate, where as contract accounts are deployed pieces of code capable of executing some computer program.

    <br>===
    <br>There are two kinds of accounts in Ethereum which share the same address space: <strong>External accounts</strong> that are controlled by public-private key pairs (i.e. humans) and <strong>contract accounts</strong> which are controlled by the code stored together with the account.
    <br>
    <br>The address of an external account is determined from the public key while the address of a contract is determined at the time the contract is created (it is derived from the creator address and the number of transactions sent from that address, the so-called “nonce”).
    <br>
    <br>Apart from the fact whether an account stores code or not, the EVM treats the two types equally, though.
    <br>
    <br>Every account has a persistent key-value store mapping 256 bit words to 256 bit words called storage.
    <br>
    <br>Furthermore, every account has a balance in Ether (in “Wei” to be exact) which can be modified by sending transactions that include Ether.

    <br>address
    <br><strong>An Ethereum address represents an account</strong>. For EOA, the address is derived as the last 20 bytes of the public key controlling the account, e.g., cd2a3d9f938e13cd947ec05abc7fe734df8dd826.
    <br>This is <strong>a hexadecimal format</strong> (base 16 notation), which is often indicated explicitly by appending 0x to the address.
    <br>Web3.js and console functions accept addresses with or without this prefix but for transparency we encourage their use.
    <br>Since each byte of the address is represented by 2 hex characters, a prefixed address is 42 characters long.
    <br>Several apps and APIs are also meant to implement the new checksum-enabled address scheme introduced in the Mist Ethereum wallet as of version 0.5.0.
    <br>hexadecimal
    <br>Common representation format for byte sequencing. Its advantage is that values are represented in a compact format using two characters per byte (the characters [0-9][a-f]).

  <p id="idEthnlartwltdsn">Description::
    <br>Accounts are the most basic way to store Ether. They are simple public/private keypairs, which you use to sign transactions. You don't need to do anything to "register" an account with the network, just generate one and send some ether to it.
    <br>
    <br>Wallets are smart-contracts that allow for advanced features such as transaction logging, multisig, withdrawal limits, and more. In order to create a wallet, you need to deploy the contract to the blockchain, which requires ether. You need to make sure you keep track not only of the keys required to access the wallet, but also the wallet address. Unlike with accounts, wallet addresses are not very easily derivable from the private key (although it's not the end of the world if you lose the wallet address, you can use a block explorer to find what contracts you've created recently). Technically you can recover the address from just the account that created it and the nonce of the transaction, but that's a hassle.

    <br>tl;dr: Start with an account, get some Ether, then create a wallet and store your ETH there

    <br>Empty accounts are functionally equivalent to nonexistent accounts with the exception of a few gas calculations, and empty accounts can easily be turned into nonempty accounts by simply sending any amount of ether to them. Theoretically, if miners accept transactions with zero fees, even sending a transaction from an empty or nonexistent account is possible. The only practical difference is that empty accounts need to be stored in the Ethereum state tree, whereas nonexistent accounts do not.

    <br>THE CRYPTO-FUEL FOR THE ETHEREUM NETWORK
    <br>[<a href="https://www.ethereum.org/ether">https://www.ethereum.org/ether</a>]
    <br>==
    <br>Ethereum ETH
    <br>Ethereum or Ether is a cryptocurrency designed to pay for the computational purposes of the Ethereum network. The name of the coin comes from the name of the platform intended to allow a network of peers to administer their own stateful user-created smart contracts in the absence of central authority.
    <br>[<a href="https://changelly.com/supported-currencies">https://changelly.com/supported-currencies</a>]
    <br>===
    <br>Ether is <strong>a necessary element -- a fuel -- for operating</strong> the distributed application platform Ethereum. It is a form of payment made by the clients of the platform to the machines executing the requested operations. To put it another way, ether is the incentive ensuring that developers write quality applications (wasteful code costs more), and that the network remains healthy (people are compensated for their contributed resources).
    <br>[<a href="https://ethereum.org/ether">https://ethereum.org/ether</a>]
    <br>===
    <br>The currency unit of Ethereum is the Ether, used to pay for computational services on the network.
    <br>
    <br>In order to finance development, Ethereum distributed the initial allocation of Ethers via a 42-day public sale, netting 31,591 bitcoins,[12] worth $18,439,086 at that time, in exchange for about 60,102,216 Ethers.
    <br>
    <br>Ether is divided into smaller units of currency called finney, szabo, shannon, babbage, lovelace, and wei. Each larger unit is equal to 1000 of the next lower unit.[13] In practice, however, the developers encourage the use of ether and wei. Wei is the base unit of implementation and can not be further divided.

    <br>How are ethers created?
    <br>The total supply of ether and its rate of issuance was decided by the donations gathered on the 2014 presale. The results were roughly:
    <br>- 60 million ether created to contributors of the presale
    <br>- 12 Million (20% of the above) were created to the development fund, most of it going to early contributors and developers and the remaining to the Ethereum Foundation
    <br>- 5 ethers are created every block (roughly 15-17 seconds) to the miner of the block
    <br>- 2-3 ethers are sometimes sent to another miner if they were also able to find a solution but his block wasn't included (called uncle/aunt reward)
    <br>[<a href="https://www.ethereum.org/ether">https://www.ethereum.org/ether</a>]
    <br>===
    <br>Ether (ETH), the cryptofuel that powers distributed applications on the Ethereum platform, will be issued at a constant annual linear rate via the block mining process. This rate is 0.3 times the total amount of ETH that will be purchased in the pre-sale.

    <br>Ethereum has a metric system of denominations used as <strong>units of ether</strong>.
    <br>Each denomination has its own unique name (some bear the family name of seminal figures playing a role in evolution of computer science and cryptoeconomics).
    <br>The smallest denomination aka base unit of ether is called Wei.
    <br>Below is a list of the named denominations and their value in Wei.
    <br>Following a common (although somewhat ambiguous) pattern, ether also designates a unit (of 1e18 or one quintillion Wei) of the currency.
    <br>Note that the currency is not called Ethereum as many mistakenly think, nor is Ethereum a unit.

  <p id="idEthevuCAggdsn">Description::
    <br>How are ethers created?
    <br>The total supply of ether and its rate of issuance was decided by the donations gathered on the 2014 presale. The results were roughly:
    <br>60 million ether created to contributors of the presale
    <br>12 Million (20% of the above) were created to the development fund, most of it going to early contributors and developers and the remaining to the Ethereum Foundation
    <br>5 ethers are created every block (roughly 15-17 seconds) to the miner of the block
    <br>2-3 ethers are sometimes sent to another miner if they were also able to find a solution but his block wasn't included (called uncle/aunt reward)
    <br>Is the ether supply infinite?
    <br>No. According to the terms agreed by all parties on the 2014 presale, issuance of ether is capped at 18 million ether per year (this number equals 25% of the initial supply). This means that while the absolute issuance is fixed, the relative inflation is decreased every year. In theory if this issuance was kept indefinitely then at some point the rate of new tokens created every year would reach the average amount lost yearly (by misuse, accidental key lost, death of holders etc) and there would reach an equilibrium.
    <br>But the rate is not expected to be kept: sometime in 2017 Ethereum will be switched from Proof of Work to a new consensus algorithm under development, called Casper that is expected to be more efficient and require less mining subsidy. The exact method of issuance and which function it will serve is an area of active research, but what can be guaranteed now is that (1) the current maximum is considered a ceiling and the new issuance under casper will not exceed it (and is expected to be much less) and (2) whatever method is ultimately picked to issue, it will be a decentralized smart contract that will not give preferential treatment to any particular group of people and whose purpose is to benefit the overall health and security of the network.

    <br>On-blockchain token systems have many applications ranging from sub-currencies <span class="clsBU">representing</span> assets such as USD or gold to company stocks, individual tokens representing smart property, secure unforgeable coupons, and even token systems with no ties to conventional value at all, used as point systems for incentivization.
    <br>Token systems are surprisingly easy to implement in Ethereum.
    <br>The key point to understand is that all a currency, or token system, fundamentally is a database with one operation: subtract X units from A and give X units to B, with the proviso that (i) A had at least X units before the transaction and (2) the transaction is approved by A.
    <br>All that it takes to implement a token system is to implement this logic into <strong>a contract</strong>.

    <br>A: Shortly after ICO. TIME is a standard ERC20 Ethereum token, it will be easy to connect it to Poloniex or other exchanges. No any additional integration will be needed, because they trade many ERC20 tokens already.

    <br>Gas is the-amount of <strong>computations</strong> of <a class="clsPreview" href="#idEthevm">EVM</a> needed to perform a-task.
    <br>Gas has a-cost, payed with <a class="clsPreview" href="#idEthevuC">ETH</a>.

    <br>Gas is the-unit of <strong>computation-cost</strong> of EVM.
    <br>[<a class="clsPreview" href="../../#idAboutme">HmnSgm</a>.2017-03-16]
    <br>===
    <br>The fundamental <span class="clsBU">unit of computation</span> is “gas”; usually, a computational step costs 1 gas, but some operations cost higher amounts of gas because they are more computationally expensive, or increase the amount of data that must be stored as part of the state. There is also a fee of 5 gas for every byte in the transaction data. The intent of the fee system is to require an attacker to pay proportionately for every resource that they consume, including computation, bandwidth and storage; hence, any transaction that leads to the network consuming a greater amount of any of these resources must have a gas fee roughly proportional to the increment.
    <br>[<a href="https://leanpub.com/decentralizedapplicationswithethereum/read_sample">https://leanpub.com/decentralizedapplicationswithethereum/read_sample</a>]
    <br>===
    <br><span class="clsU">Gas Cost</span> is a static value for how much a computation costs in terms of Gas, and the intent is that the real value of the Gas never changes, so this cost should always stay stable over time.
    <br>[<a href="https://ethereum-homestead.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ether.html#gas-and-ether">https://ethereum-homestead.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ether.html#gas-and-ether</a>]
    <br>===
    <br>Executing transactions on Ethereum either runs computations or stores data.
    <br>This Costs the network CPU cycles or storage space.
    <br>That cost is paid for by the account that initiates the transaction.
    <br><strong>The payment is called "gas"</strong>.
    <br>Gas is currently paid using ETH.
    <br>At the time of writing this, 1 GAS = 0.00001 ETH.

    <br>===
    <br><strong>Just like a car needs so many gallons to travel such a distance, Ethereum transactions require so much Ether to spin so many CPU cycles or store such a quantity of data</strong>.
    <br>By simple virtue of Ether being a scarce and valuable resource, DoS attacks are prevented.
    <br>A blockchain billionaire looking to burn their fortune on a prank could slow the network for a time, but the winning miner of the nefarious transaction’s block would see quite a payday!

    <br>===
    <br>Gas: The fundamental network <strong>cost unit</strong>.
    <br>Paid for exclusively by Ether (as of PoC-4), which is converted freely to and from Gas as required.
    <br>Gas does not exist outside of the internal Ethereum computation engine; its price is set by the Transaction and miners are free to ignore Transactions whose Gas price is too low.
    <br>[<a href="https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf">https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf</a>]
    <br>===
    <br>Gas: a measurement <strong>roughly equivalent to computational steps</strong>. Every transaction is required to include a gas limit and a fee that it is willing to pay per gas; miners have the choice of including the transaction and collecting the fee or not. If the total number of gas used by the computation spawned by the transaction, including the original message and any sub-messages that may be triggered, is less than or equal to the gas limit, then the transaction processes. If the total gas exceeds the gas limit, then all changes are reverted, except that the transaction is still valid and the fee can still be collected by the miner. Every operation has a gas expenditure; for most operations it is 1, although some expensive operations fave expenditures up to 100 and a transaction itself has an expenditure of 500.
    <br>[<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Glossary">https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Glossary</a>]
    <br>===
    <br>The principle behind Gas is to have a stable value for how much a transaction or computation costs on the Ethereum network.
    <br>[<a href="https://ethereum-homestead.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ether.html#gas-and-ether">https://ethereum-homestead.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ether.html#gas-and-ether</a>]
    <br>===
    <br>Gas is <strong>the relative cost</strong> between operations.
    <br>So:
    <br>- a single step calculation like if(2 > 1) will cost 1 gas
    <br>- an operation to store a value in storage will cost 100 gas
    <br>If you want to run a contract, this means a certain amount of operations will be executed. The total gas cost of those operations will be the cost of your transaction. It's like the amount of cpu cycles per operation. Everytime you send a transaction to a contract, you need to specify 3 numbers:
    <br>- value: the amount of ether you want to send into the account balance
    <br>- gas: the maximum amount of gas that may be used for processing a transaction
    <br>- gas-price the price per unit of gas you are willing to pay
    <br>The processing cost (fee) you offer for the transaction will be calculated as:
    <br>
    <br>gas * gas-price (in eth/g) = ether
    <br>
    <br>Gas is just a way to express relative cost and you can't send gas from 1 person to another. It is not a sub-currency like some people tend to think.

    <br>gasPrice
    <br>A user constructs and signs a transaction, and each user <strong>may specify</strong> whatever gasPrice they desire, which can be zero.
    <br>However, the Ethereum clients launched at Frontier had a default gasPrice of 0.05e12 wei.
    <br>As miners optimize for their revenue, if most transactions are being submitted with a gasPrice of 0.05e12 wei, it would be difficult to convince a miner to accept a transaction that specified a lower, or zero, gasPrice.

    <br>===
    <br>Gas Price is how much Gas costs in terms of another currency or token like Ether.
    <br>To stabilise the value of gas, the Gas Price is a floating value such that if the cost of tokens or currency fluctuates, the Gas Price changes to keep the same real value.
    <br>The Gas Price is set by the equilibrium price of how much users are willing to spend, and how much processing nodes are willing to accept.

    <br>Gas Fee is effectively <strong>the amount of Gas</strong> needed to be paid to run a particular transaction or program (called a contract). The Gas Fees of a block can be used to imply the computational load, transaction volume, or size of a block. The gas fees are paid to the miners (or bonded contractors in PoS).

  <p id="idEthgovdsn">Description::
    <br>the Ethereum governance process are not very well documented, and it’s hard to understand them without actively participating in them. They evolved over time, and are not an institutionalization of a formal model, and therefore have no inherent reason to be easy to identify or communicate.
    <br>No one has full information about the structure of the processes involved. Partly because documenting reality is hard work, and so is communication and education. Partly because the processes are still evolving. And also partly because people only inevitably learn about the processes that they participate in themselves. Most observers don’t participate, and can’t be expected to understand the process, at least until clear documentation is available.
    <br>To clear up some of the misinformation about Ethereum governance shared in Fred’s blog: Proof-of-stake will not change the Ethereum governance processes at all, and miners *do not* have a significant influence on the governance process today. Moreover, Vitalik does not have nearly the amount of power to influence governance outcomes that Fred (and lots of other people) assume that he does. The structure of the governance processes limit Vitalik’s power, just as it limits everyone’s power.

    <br>To make your Πapp work on Ethereum, you can use the web3 object provided by the web3.js library.
    <br>Under the hood it communicates to a local node through RPC calls.
    <br>web3.js works with any Ethereum node, which exposes an RPC layer.
    <br>
    <br>web3 contains the eth object - web3.eth (for specifically Ethereum blockchain interactions) and the shh object - web3.shh (for Whisper interaction). Over time we'll introduce other objects for each of the other web3 protocols. Working examples can be found here.
    <br>
    <br>If you want to look at some more sophisticated examples using web3.js check out these useful Πapp patterns.

    <br>The EVM is not a register machine but <strong>a stack machine</strong>, so all computations are performed on an area called the stack.
    <br>It has a maximum size of 1024 elements and contains words of 256 bits. Access to the stack is limited to the top end in the following way: It is possible to copy one of the topmost 16 elements to the top of the stack or swap the topmost element with one of the 16 elements below it. All other operations take the topmost two (or one, or more, depending on the operation) elements from the stack and push the result onto the stack. Of course it is possible to move stack elements to storage or memory, but it is not possible to just access arbitrary elements deeper in the stack without first removing the top of the stack.

    <br>The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is <strong>the runtime environment for smart contracts</strong> in Ethereum. It is not only sandboxed, but actually completely isolated, which means that code running inside the EVM has no access to network, filesystem, or other processes. Smart contracts even have limited access to other smart contracts.
    <br>Contracts live on the blockchain in an Ethereum-specific binary format (EVM bytecode). However, contracts are typically written in an Ethereum high level language, <span class="clsU">compiled into byte code</span> using an EVM compiler, and finally uploaded on the blockchain using an Ethereum client.

    <br>The Ethereum Virtual Machine is the primary innovation of the Ethereum project. This is a virtual machine designed to be run by all participants in a peer to peer network, it can read and write to a blockchain both executable code and data, Verify digital signatures, and is able to run code in a quasi-Turing complete manner. It will only execute code when it receives a message verified by a digital signature, and the information stored on the blockchain tells it is appropriate to do so.

    <br>Ethereum enables this complexity by <strong>placing a virtual machine (called the Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM) in every node on the network</strong>.
    <br>The EVM is not conceptually different than any other virtual machine.
    <br>You may already be familiar with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), for example.
    <br>Just like JVM code will run on any machine hosting a JVM and produce identical outputs over the same set of inputs, the EVM enables the Ethereum blockchain to reach consensus about the proper output of any EVM code based on a set of inputs.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthevmsgarH3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idEthevmsgardsn">Description::
    <br>Each account has <strong>a persistent memory area</strong> which is called storage.
    <br>Storage is a key-value store that maps 256-bit words to 256-bit words.
    <br>It is not possible to enumerate storage from within a contract and it is comparatively costly to read and even more so, to modify storage.
    <br><strong>A contract can neither read nor write to any storage apart from its own</strong>.
    <br>[<a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.9/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#storage-memory-and-the-stack">https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.9/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#storage-memory-and-the-stack</a>]
    <br>===
    <br>Unlike stack and memory, which reset after computation ends, storage persists for the long term.
    <br>... While the Ethereum virtual machine is running, its full computational state can be defined by the tuple (block_state, transaction, message, code, memory, stack, pc, gas), where block_state is the global state containing all accounts and includes balances and storage.

    <br>===
    <br>Complex types, i.e. types which do not always fit into 256 bits have to be handled more carefully than the value-types we have already seen. Since copying them can be quite expensive, we have to think about whether we want them to be stored in memory (which is not persisting) or <strong>storage (where the state variables are held)</strong>.

    <br>===
    <br>“Contracts” in Ethereum should not be seen as something that should be “fulfilled” or “complied with”; rather, they are more like “autonomous agents” that live inside of the Ethereum execution environment, always executing a specific piece of code when “poked” by a message or transaction, and having direct control over their own ether balance and their own <strong>key/value store</strong> to store their permanent state.

  <p id="idEthevmmrardsn">Description::
    <br>The second memory area is called memory, of which a contract obtains a freshly cleared instance for each message call.
    <br>Memory is linear and can be addressed at byte level, but reads are limited to a width of 256 bits, while writes can be either 8 bits or 256 bits wide.
    <br>Memory is expanded by a word (256-bit), when accessing (either reading or writing) a previously untouched memory word (ie. any offset within a word).
    <br>At the time of expansion, the cost in gas must be paid.
    <br>Memory is more costly the larger it grows (it scales quadratically).

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthevmscrtH3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idEthevmscrtdsn">Description::
    <br>The EVM is a security oriented virtual machine, designed to permit untrusted code to be executed by a global network of computers. To do so securely, it imposes the following restrictions:
    <br>- Every computational step taken in a program's execution must be paid for up front, thereby preventing Denial-of-Service attacks.
    <br>- Programs may only interact with each other by transmitting a single arbitrary-length byte array; they do not have access to each other's state.
    <br>- Program execution is sandboxed; an EVM program may access and modify its own internal state and may trigger the execution of other EVM programs, but nothing else.
    <br>- Program execution is fully deterministic and produces identical state transitions for any conforming implementation beginning in an identical state.
    <br>These restrictions motivated many of the design decisions of the overall Ethereum state transition machine, and their enforcement is pervasive throughout the specification.

    <br>===
    <br>The Ethereum Virtual Machine or EVM is the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum.
    <br>It is not only sandboxed but actually completely isolated, which means that code running inside the EVM has no access to network, filesystem or other processes.
    <br>Smart contracts even have limited access to other smart contracts.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthevmcdexgH3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idEthevmcdexgdsn">Description::
    <br>In general, code execution is an infinite loop that consists of repeatedly carrying out the operation at the current program counter (which begins at zero) and then incrementing the program counter by one, until the end of the code is reached or an error or STOP or RETURN instruction is detected.
    <br>...
    <br>The code can also access the value, sender and data of the incoming message, as well as block header data, and the code can also return a byte array of data as an output.
    <br>The formal execution model of EVM code is surprisingly simple. While the Ethereum virtual machine is running, its full computational state can be defined by the tuple (block_state, transaction, message, code, memory, stack, pc, gas), where block_state is the global state containing all accounts and includes balances and storage. At the start of every round of execution, the current instruction is found by taking the pcth (Program Counter) byte of code (or 0 if pc >= len(code)), and each instruction has its own definition in terms of how it affects the tuple. For example, ADD pops two items off the stack and pushes their sum, reduces gas by 1 and increments pc by 1, and SSTORE pops the top two items off the stack and inserts the second item into the contract's storage at the index specified by the first item. Although there are many ways to optimize Ethereum virtual machine execution via just-in-time compilation, a basic implementation of Ethereum can be done in a few hundred lines of code.
    <br>[<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper#code-execution">https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper#code-execution</a>]
    <br>===
    <br>... A commonly asked question is "where" contract code is executed, in terms of physical hardware.
    <br>This has a simple answer: the process of executing contract code is part of the definition of the state transition function, which is part of the block validation algorithm, so if a transaction is added into block B the code execution spawned by that transaction will be executed by all nodes, now and in the future, that download and validate block B.

    <br>MetaMask is a bridge that allows you to visit <strong>the distributed web</strong> of tomorrow in your browser today. It allows you to run Ethereum dApps right in your browser without running a full Ethereum node.

    <br>MetaMask includes a secure identity vault, providing a user interface to manage your identities on different sites and sign blockchain transactions.
    <br>
    <br>We’re initially building MetaMask as a Chrome plugin, but eventually plan to support Firefox and beyond. If you’re a developer, you can start developing with MetaMask today.
    <br>
    <br>Our mission is to make Ethereum as easy to use for as many people as possible.

  <p id="idEthtrpcdsn">Description::
    <br>There are many Ethereum clients to choose from.
    <br>We recommend using different clients when developing and deploying.
    <br>WHEN DEVELOPING
    <br>EthereumJS TestRPC: https://github.com/ethereumjs/testrpc
    <br>When developing your Truffle-based application, we recommend using the EthereumJS TestRPC. It's a complete blockchain-in-memory that runs only on your development machine. It processes transactions instantly instead of waiting for the default block time – so you can test that your code works quickly – and it tells you immediately when your smart contracts run into errors. It also makes a great client for automated testing, and Truffle knows how to use its special features to speed up test runtime by almost 90%.
    <br>[<a href="http://truffleframework.com/docs/getting_started/client">http://truffleframework.com/docs/getting_started/client</a>]
    <br>===
    <br>There are various compatible clients for the protocol, the most popular being geth, a Go language implementation. However, it’s not the most developer-friendly. The best option I’ve found is the testrpc node (yes, the name sucks). Trust me, it will save you a lot of time. Install it and run it:
    <br>$ sudo npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc
    <br>$ testrpc
    <br>You should run <code>testrpc</code> in a new terminal and leave it running while you develop. Each time you run testrpc, it will generate 10 new addresses with simulated test funds for you to use. This is not real money and you’re safe to try anything with no risk of losing funds.

    <br>
    <br>This release adds some additional log information to the splash screen and adds a feature to send all ether for an account.
    <br>
    <br>Full list of changes:
    <br>
    <br>Added a send-all functionality to the send page.
    <br>Add German (thanks to @ColRad) and Portuguese (@alexvandesande) translation for the wallet!
    <br>Added log infos to the splash screen, so users can see what the node is currently doing...
    <br>Improved ether display precision on the confirmation screen
    <br>Added a check with NTP servers to see if the computer time is correct, if not it shows an error
    <br>Increased error timeout
    <br>If you should notice that your wallet links lead to a white page, please run the following script in the console:
    <br>https://gist.github.com/frozeman/ed41008f4d30900da3e8
    <br>This changes all your wallet addresses internally back to lowercase (we introduced that by accident).

    <br>Proof of Authority Chains
    <br>Available only in 1.5 and above.
    <br>Parity supports a Proof-of-Authority consensus engine to be used with EVM based chains. Proof-of-Authority is a replacement for Proof-of-Work, which can be used for private chain setups.
    <br>It does not depend on nodes solving arbitrarily difficult mathematical problems, but instead uses a hard-configured set of "authorities" - nodes that are explicitly allowed to create new blocks and secure the blockchain. This makes it easier to maintain a private chain and keep the block issuers accountable.

    <br>Windows, Linux or Mac OS X
    <br>Truffle also requires that you have a running Ethereum client which supports the standard JSON RPC API (nearly all of them). There are many to choose from, and some better than others for development. We'll discuss them in detail in the next section.
    <br>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WINDOWS
    <br>If you're a Windows user, we recommend installing and using Truffle via Windows PowerShell or Git BASH. These two shells provide features far beyond the standard Command Prompt, and will make your life on the command line much easier.
    <br>[<a href="http://truffleframework.com/docs/getting_started/installation">http://truffleframework.com/docs/getting_started/installation</a>]
    <br>===
    <br>RESOLVING NAMING CONFLICTS ON WINDOWS
    <br>When using the Command Prompt on Windows, the default configuration file name can cause a conflict with the truffle executable. If this is the case, we recommend using Windows PowerShell or Git BASH as these shells do not have this conflict. Alternatively, you can rename the configuration file to truffle-config.js to avoid this conflict.

    <br>Formerly known as Genoil's CUDA miner, ethminer-0.9.41-genoil-1.x.x is a fork of the stock ethminer version 0.9.41. While native CUDA support is its most significant difference, it has the following additional features:
    <br>- realistic benchmarking against arbitrary epoch/DAG/blocknumber
    <br>- on-GPU DAG generation (no more DAG files on disk)
    <br>- stratum mining without proxy
    <br>- OpenCL devices picking

    <br>What is the difference between smart contracts and dapps?
    <br>Anupam Vijayvergia
    <br>Written Nov 2
    <br>In simplest terms Dapps or rather decentralised apps is <strong>an app running on a decentralised network</strong>. Dapps has its backend and can have a front end code or user interface written on any language. However backend code runs on a decentralised network.
    <br>Smart contracts is a piece of code that is meant to do a specific purpose which is part of a decentralised application.
    <br>[<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-smart-contracts-and-dapps/answer/Anupam-Vijayvergia?srid=uJVpm">https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-smart-contracts-and-dapps/answer/Anupam-Vijayvergia?srid=uJVpm</a>]
    <br>===
    <br>The Ethereum platform itself is featureless or value-agnostic. Similar to programming languages, it is up to entrepreneurs and developers to decide what it should be used for. However, it is clear that certain application types benefit more than others from Ethereum’s capabilities. Specifically, ethereum is suited for applications that automate direct interaction between peers or facilitate coordinated group action across a network. For instance, applications for coordinating peer-to-peer marketplaces, or the automation of complex financial contracts. Bitcoin allows for individuals to exchange cash without involving any middlemen like financial institutions, banks, or governments. Ethereum’s impact may be more far-reaching. In theory, financial interactions or exchanges of any complexity could be carried out automatically and reliably using code running on Ethereum. Beyond financial applications, any environments where trust, security, and permanence are important – for instance, asset-registries, voting, governance, and the internet of things – could be massively impacted by the Ethereum platform.

    <br>The term decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is often used in the same breath as "smart contract" or "blockchain".
    <br>DAOs are touted as a new form of legal structure in which ownership, management and control are automated and human involvement is limited or removed, based on a previously agreed upon set of rules.

  <h4 id="idEthddwpr0H4">Abstract
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr0H4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idEthddwpr0P1">This paper describes the first implementation of Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) code to automate organizational governance and decision-making.
    <br>The code can be used by individuals working together collaboratively outside of a traditional corporate form.
    <br>It can also be used by a registered corporate entity to automate formal governance rules contained in corporate bylaws or imposed by law.
    <br>First the DAO concept is described, then minority rights is discussed, and a solution to a “robbing the minority” attack vector is proposed.
    <br>Finally, a practical implementation of a first generation DAO entity is provided using smart contracts written in Solidity on the Ethereum blockchain.

  <section id="idEthddwpr1">
  <h4 id="idEthddwpr1H4">1. Introduction
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr1H4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idEthddwpr1P1">Corporate entities of all kinds are governed by rules that describe permitted and proscribed conduct.
    <br>These rules may exist as private contracts (like bylaws or shareholder agreements) between corporate owners.
    <br>They may also be imposed by law in addition to or in the absence of a written agreement between participants.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr1P1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr1P2">Historically, corporations have only been able to act through people (or through corporate entities that were themselves ultimately controlled by people).
    <br>This presents two simple and fundamental problems.
    <br>Whatever a private contract or public law require: (1) people do not always follow the rules and (2) people do not always agree what the rules actually require.
    <br>Collaboration without a corporate form does not solve these problems, necessarily, and it may introduce others.
    <br>In the absence of a corporate form, an explicit written agreement is substituted for unclear informal “understandings” and the legal protections provided by a corporate form will not be available.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr1P2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr1P3">Rule-breaking within an organization not always obvious, and motives may not matter to stakeholders once their money has been lost.
    <br>While bad behavior may make a corporation or its management civilly or criminally liable, punishment can come as little comfort to an investor who has already lost their money.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr1P3"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr1P4">Crowdfunding (<a class="clsPreview" href="#idMassolution2015">Massolution [2015]</a>) amplifies the problem.
    <br>On the one hand, it has made it easier for small contributors to invest in large projects, and it has also made it possible for entrepreneurs to receive financial support that might not have been easily available in the past.
    <br>On the other hand, small investors remain vulnerable to financial mismanagement or outright fraud, and because they have a small stake in a venture, they may lack power to identify problems, participate in governance decisions, or to easily recover their investment (<a class="clsPreview" href="#idKnibbs2015">Knibbs [2015]</a>, <a class="clsPreview" href="#idBiggs2015">Biggs [2015]</a>).
    <br>At the same time, corporate leadership and management may be accused of malfeasance or mismanagement when they believe that they have acted in good faith, based on their understanding of their obligations and interpretation of applicable rules.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr1P4"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr1P5">This paper presents a potential solution using Ethereum, (<a class="clsPreview" href="#idButerin2013">Buterin [2013]</a>, <a class="clsPreview" href="#idWood2014">Wood [2014]</a>) a blockchain technology which integrates a Turing complete programming language with smart contract processing functionality.
    <br>This paper illustrates a method that for the first time allows the creation of organizations in which (1) participants maintain direct real-time control of contributed funds and (2) governance rules are formalized, automated and enforced using software.
    <br>Specifically, standard smart contract code (<a class="clsPreview" href="#idSzabo1997">Szabo [1997]</a>, <a class="clsPreview" href="#idMiller1997">Miller [1997]</a>) has been written that can be used to form a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) on the Ethereum blockchain.
    <br>This paper explains how a DAO’s code works, focusing on some basic formation and governance features, including structure, creation and voting rights.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr1P5"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr1P6">First a DAO’s Creation Phase and basic functionality are described.
    <br>Then minority owner rights are discussed and a solution to the “Majority Robbing the Minority Attack” problem is proposed: the “DAO split.”
    <br>The smart contract code is then explored in detail, and conclude with an explanation and detailed specification of the “DAO split.”
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr1P6"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr1P7">The code for the smart contracts is located at: <a href="https://github.com/slockit/DAO/">https://github.com/slockit/DAO</a>/
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr1P7"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr1P8">A word of caution, at the outset: the legal status of DAOs remains the subject of active and vigorous debate and discussion.
    <br>Not everyone shares the same definition.
    <br>Some have said that they are autonomous code and can operate independently of legal systems; others have said that they must be owned or operate by humans or human created entities.
    <br>There will be many uses cases, and the DAO code will develop over time.
    <br>Ultimately, how a DAO functions and its legal status will depend on many factors, including how DAO code is used, where it is used, and who uses it.
    <br>This paper does not speculate about the legal status of DAOs worldwide.
    <br>This paper is not intended to offer legal advice or conclusions.
    <br>Anyone who uses DAO code will do so at their own risk.

  <section id="idEthddwpr2">
  <h4 id="idEthddwpr2H4">2. Dao Concept
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr2H4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idEthddwpr2P1">DAO code is written in the “Solidity” programming language.
    <br>A DAO is activated by deployment on the Ethereum blockchain.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr2P1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr2P2">Once deployed, a DAO’s code requires “ether” to engage in transactions on Ethereum.
    <br>Ether is the digital fuel that powers the Ethereum network.
    <br>Without ether, a DAO can not do anything so a DAO’s first order of business is to receive ether.
    <br>After a DAO’s code is deployed, ether may be sent to the DAO’s smart contract address during an initial Creation Phase which is defined in the DAO’s code.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr2P2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr2P3">In exchange for ether, a DAO’s code creates tokens that are assigned to the account of the person who sent the ether.
    <br>The token grants its holder voting and ownership rights.
    <br>The number of tokens created is proportional to the amount of ether transferred.
    <br>Token price varies over time (see <a class="clsPreview" href="#idEthddwpr5">section 5</a>).
    <br>Token ownership is freely transferable on the Ethereum blockchain, when the Creation Phase has ended.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr2P3"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr2P4">A minimum DAO Creation goal and Creation Phase time-period are set as parameters in a DAO’s code at the time of deployment.
    <br>If the minimum DAO Creation goal is not reached at the close of the Creation Phase, all ether is returned.
    <br>After the Creation Phase has ended, the total ether raised is denoted by Ξraised and the total amount of tokens created is denoted by Ttotal.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr2P4"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr2P5">A DAO stores ether and other Ethereum based tokens and transmits them based on the DAO’s code.
    <br>It does not do much else.
    <br>It cannot build a product, write code or develop hardware.
    <br>It requires a “Contractor” to accomplish these and other goals.
    <br>A DAO selects a Contractor by accepting a Contractor’s proposal.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr2P5"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr2P6">Any DAO Token Holder may become a Contractor by submitting proposals to use a DAO’s ether, denoted by Ξtransfer.
    <br>If a proposal is approved, the DAO transmits ether to a smart contract representing the proposed project.
    <br>Such smart contracts can be parameterized and enable a DAO to interact with and influence the project it chose to support.
    <br>An example of such an agreement between a DAO and a project to be funded can be found in <a class="clsPreview" href="#idEthddwprA4">the appendix (A.4)</a>.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr2P6"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr2P7">Members of a DAO cast votes weighted by the amount of tokens they control.
    <br>Tokens are divisible, indistinguishable and can easily be transferred between accounts.
    <br>Within the contracts, the individual actions of members, cannot be directly determined.
    <br>There is a set time frame tp to debate and vote on any given proposal.
    <br>In our example, this time frame is set by the creator of the proposal, and is required to be at least two weeks for a regular proposal.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr2P7"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr2P8">After tp has passed, any token holder can call a function in the DAO contract that will verify that the majority voted in favor of the proposal and that quorum was reached; the function will execute the proposal if this is the case.
    <br>If this is not the case, the proposal will be closed.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr2P8"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpreqn1">The minimum quorum represents the minimum number of tokens required for a vote to be valid, is denoted by qmin, and calculated as follows:
    <br>
    <br><img src="filMcsDtcnet.files/imgEthddwprEqn1.png"> (eqn.1)
    <br>
    <br>Where d is the minQuorumDivisor.
    <br>This parameter’s default value is 5, but it will double in the case the quorum has not been met for over a year.
    <br>ΞDAO is the amount of ether owned by a DAO and RDAO is the amount of reward tokens owned by this DAO, as explained in <a class="clsPreview" href="#idEthddwpr7">section 7</a> (also see rewardToken in <a class="clsPreview" href="#idEthddwprA3">A.3</a>).
    <br>The sum ΞDAO + RDAO is equal to the amount of ether used to Create DAO tokens plus the rewards received or said another way, the total amount of ether a DAO has ever received.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpreqn1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr2P9">This means, initially, a quorum of 20% of all tokens is required for any proposal to pass.
    <br>In the event Ξtransfer equals the amount of ether a DAO has ever received, then a quorum of 53.33% is required.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr2P9"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr2P10">In order to prevent “proposal spam,” a minimal deposit can be required to be paid when creating a proposal, which gets refunded if quorum is achieved.
    <br>If quorum is not achieved, the DAO keeps the proposal deposit.
    <br>The value of the proposal deposit can be changed from the default value by the DAO through another proposal.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr2P10"></a></p>

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr4H4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idEthddwpr4P1">Minority owner rights can be a problem in any corporate form.
    <br>Minority rights may be protected or addressed by provisions in corporate governance documents or by statute or judge-made law.
    <br>But many of these solutions fail because minority owners may lack voting rights or the ability to “vote with their feet” and easily retrieve their capital.
    <br>This paper presents a solution to this problem in the DAO’s code.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr4P1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr4P2">A problem every DAO has to mitigate is the ability for the majority to rob the minority by changing governance and ownership rules after DAO formation.
    <br>For example, an attacker with 51% of the tokens, acquired either during the fueling period or created afterwards, could make a proposal to send all the funds to themselves.
    <br>Since they would hold the majority of the tokens, they would always be able to pass their proposals.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr4P2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr4P3">To prevent this, the minority must always have the ability to retrieve their portion of the funds.
    <br>Our solution is to allow a DAO to split into two.
    <br>If an individual, or a group of token holders, disagree with a proposal and want to retrieve their portion of the ether before the proposal gets executed, they can submit and approve a special type of proposal to form a new DAO.
    <br>The token holders that voted for this proposal can then split the DAO moving their portion of the ether to this new DAO, leaving the rest alone only able to spend their own ether.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr4P3"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr4P4">This idea originates from a blog post by Vitalik Buterin (<a class="clsPreview" href="#idButerin2015">Buterin [2015]</a>).
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr4P4"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr4P5">A problem this simple fix doesn’t address is voter apathy:
    <br>some token holders might not be actively involved in their DAO and might not follow proposals closely.
    <br>An attacker could use this to their advantage.
    <br>Even though the minority has the chance to retrieve their funds and split the DAO, some could be unaware of the situation and fail to act.
    <br>For a DAO to be considered safe, it is required that inactive token holders must also be protected from losing their ether.
    <br>Our proposed solution is implemented by limiting each individual DAO to a single Curator.
    <br>This Curator controls the list of addresses that can receive ether from the DAO, across all proposals.
    <br>This gives the Curator of a DAO considerable power.
    <br>To prevent the abuse of this power, it is possible for a DAO to vote for a new Curator, which may result in a split of the DAO as described above.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr4P5"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr4P6">Any token holder can make a proposal to vote for a new Curator.
    <br>In effect, even a single token holder is able to both retrieve their remaining portion of ether and maintain their right to any future rewards associated to their previous contribution, as these will be sent to the new DAO automatically.
    <br>Rewards are defined as any ether received by a DAO generated from products the DAO funded so far and are explained in further detail in <a class="clsPreview" href="#idEthddwpr7">section 7</a>.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr4P6"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr4P7">The process of choosing a new Curator is as follows:
    <br>Any token holder can submit a proposal for a new Curator.
    <br>In this case, no proposal deposit is required, because an attacker could vote for an extremely high deposit, preventing any splits.
    <br>The debating period for this proposal is 7 days.
    <br>This is 7 days less than the minimum required for regular proposals, allowing anyone to retrieve their funds before a potentially malicious proposal goes through.
    <br>There is no quorum requirement, so that every token holder has the ability to split into their own DAO.
    <br>The debating period is used to discuss (on or off-chain) the new Curator and conduct a first vote that’s non-binding.
    <br>After this first vote, token holders can confirm its results or not.
    <br>In the case a majority opts to keep the original Curator, the minority can either keep the original Curator in order to avoid a split, or inversely they can confirm their vote for a new Curator and move their portion of the ether to a new DAO.

  <h4 id="idEthddwpr5H4">5. Token Price
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr5H4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idEthddwpreqn2-3">DAO Token Creation rate decreases over time.
    <br>This reflects an assumption that early acts of DAO Creation have greater risk, as they may have less information about the potential success of the DAO and do not know whether what contribution will lead to full fueling of the DAO.
    <br>The DAO described in this paper has the following Creation schedule:
    <br>
    <br><img src="filMcsDtcnet.files/imgEthddwprEqn2-3.png"> (eqn.2-3)
    <br>
    <br>Here t is the unix time in seconds, tc is the closing time of the fueling period (see <a class="clsPreview" href="#idEthddwprA2">A.2</a> closingTime), w is a week in seconds and d a day in seconds.
    <br>Hence the number of tokens (in its base unit) each person Creates is calculated as: P(t)· Ξc.
    <br>Here Ξc stands for the amount of ether sent to fuel a DAO, denoted in wei.
    <br>This results in a constant Creation rate in the beginning, until 2 weeks before the end of the DAO Creation Phase.
    <br>At this time the amount of ether required to Create DAO tokens increases daily by 0.05 Ξc per base unit of DAO token.
    <br>Until 4 days before the closing time when there will be a constant Creation rate of 1.5 Ξc per base unit of DAO token.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpreqn2-3"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr5P1">Creation rate decreases during the Creation Phase could lead to a situation where a single contributor, having Created DAO tokens at the initial Creation rate, could split the DAO immediately after the Creation Phase ends, thereby receiving more ether than they put in due to other contributors having fueled a DAO at a higher Creation rate (<a href="idGreen2016">Green [2016]</a>).
    <br>In order to avoid that possibility, all ether that is used to fuel a DAO above the initial Creation rate, will be sent to an extra account.
    <br>Denoted as extraBalance in <a class="clsPreview" href="#idEthddwprA2">A.2</a>.
    <br>This ether can be sent back to the DAO through a proposal after the DAO has spent at least this amount of ether.
    <br>This rule is implemented in the internal function isRecipientAllowed in <a class="clsPreview" href="#idEthddwpr63">section 6.3</a>.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr6H4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idEthddwpr6P1">This section will detail the smart contracts implementing the aforementioned concept.
    <br>The contracts are written in the programming language Solidity (<a class="clsPreview" href="#idReitwWood2015">Reitwiessner and Wood [2015]</a>).
    <br>Each contract has member variables and functions which can be externally called by sending a transaction to the Ethereum network with the DAO contract address as the recipient and the method ID (optional with parameters) as data.
    <br>This section will discuss the meaning of the variables and the functions in detail.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr6P1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr6P2">The main contract is called ’DAO’.
    <br>It defines the inner workings of the DAO and it derives the member variables and functions from ’Token’ and ’TokenCreation’.
    <br>Token defines the inner workings of the DAO Token and TokenCreation defines how the DAO token is created by fueling the DAO with ether.
    <br>In addition to these three contracts, there is the ’ManagedAccount’ contract, which acts as a helper contract to store the rewards which are to be distributed to the token holders and the extraBalance (see <a class="clsPreview" href="#idEthddwpr5">section 5</a>).
    <br>The contract ’SampleOffer’ (<a class="clsPreview" href="#idEthddwprA4">A.4</a>) is an example of what a proposal from a contractor to the DAO could look like.

    <br>Many of the member variables that are used in this contract are defined in one of the other three contracts.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P40"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P41">There is a special function which is called the constructor.
    <br>It has the same name as the contract “DAO.”
    <br>This function is only executed once, when the DAO is created.
    <br>In the DAO constructor, the following variables are set:
    <br>• curator
    <br>• daoCreator
    <br>• proposalDeposit
    <br>• rewardAccount
    <br>• DAOrewardAccount
    <br>• minTokensToCreate

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P41"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P42">In order to interact with the smart contract the following functions are used:
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P42"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P43">fallback function. The fallback function is a function without a specific name.
    <br>It is called when the contract receives a transaction without data (a pure value transfer).
    <br>There are no direct arguments for this function.
    <br>The fallback function will call createTokenProxy passing the address of the sender as an argument during the Creation Phase.
    <br>This will trigger the immediate creation of tokens.
    <br>In order to protect users, this function will send the ether received after the end of the Creation Phase back to the sender for a time period of 40 days.
    <br>After which this function is repurposed to receive ether as simple deposit to the DAO using the function receiveEther.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P43"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P44">receiveEther. A simple function used to receive ether.
    <br>It does nothing but return true when the DAO receives ether.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P44"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P45">newProposal. This function is used to create a new proposal.
    <br>The arguments of the function are:
    <br>recipient: The address of the recipient of the ether in the proposal (has to be the DAO address itself, the current Curator or an address on the whitelist allowedRecipients).
    <br>amount: The amount of wei to be sent in the proposed transaction.
    <br>description: A string describing the proposal.
    <br>transactionData: The data of the proposed transaction.
    <br>debatingPeriod: The amount of time to debate the proposal, at least 2 weeks for a normal proposal
    <br>and at least 1 week for a new Curator proposal.
    <br>newCurator: A boolean defining whether this proposal is for a new Curator or not.
    <br>After checking the sanity of the proposal (see code), this function creates a proposal which is open for voting for a certain amount of time.
    <br>The function will return a proposal ID which is used to vote.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P45"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P46">checkProposalCode. This function is used to check that a certain proposal ID matches a certain transaction.
    <br>The arguments of the function are:
    <br>proposalID: The proposal ID.
    <br>recipient: The address of the recipient of the proposed transaction.
    <br>amount: The amount of wei to be sent with the proposed transaction.
    <br>transactionData: The data of the proposed transaction.
    <br>If the recipient, the amount and the transactionData match the proposal ID, the function will return true, otherwise it will return false.
    <br>This will be used to verify that the proposal ID matches what the DAO token holder thinks they are voting on.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P46"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P47">vote. This function is used to vote on a proposal.
    <br>The arguments of the function are:
    <br>proposalID: The proposal ID.
    <br>supportsProposal: A boolean Yes/No does the DAO token holder support the proposal
    <br>The function simply checks whether the sender has yet to vote and whether the proposal is still open for voting.
    <br>If both requirements are met, it records the vote in the storage of the contract.
    <br>The tokens used to vote will be blocked, meaning they can not be transferred until the proposal is closed.
    <br>This is to avoid voting several times with different sender addresses.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P47"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P48">executeProposal. This function can be called by anyone.
    <br>It counts the votes, in order to check whether the quorum is met, and executes the proposal if it passed, unless it is a proposal for a new Curator, than it does nothing.
    <br>The arguments of the function are:
    <br>proposalID: The proposal ID.
    <br>transactionData: The data of the proposed transaction
    <br>The function checks whether the voting deadline has passed and that the transactionData matches the proposal ID.
    <br>Then it checks whether the quorum has been met (see Eq. 1) and if the proposal had a majority of support.
    <br>If this is the case, it executes the proposal and refunds the proposal deposit.
    <br>If the quorum has been achieved, but the proposal was declined by the majority of the voters, the proposal deposit is refunded and the proposal closes.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P48"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P49">splitDAO. After a new Curator has been proposed, and the debating period in which the token holders could vote for or against the proposal has passed, this function is called by each of the DAO token holders that want to leave the current DAO and move to a new DAO with the proposed new Curator.
    <br>This function creates a new DAO and moves a portion of the ether, as well as a portion of the reward tokens to the new DAO.
    <br>The arguments are:
    <br>proposalID: The proposal ID.
    <br>newCurator: The address of the new Curator of the new DAO.
    <br>After a sanity check (see code), this function will create the new DAO if it hasnt already been created using the contract daoCreator, updates the split data stored in the proposal and stores the address of the new DAO in the split data.
    <br>This function moves the portion of ether that belongs to the caller of this function in the original DAO to the new DAO.
    <br>This ether amount is denoted by Ξsender, stated in wei and is calculated as follows:
    <br>
    <br><img src="filMcsDtcnet.files/imgEthddwprEqn4.png"> (eqn.4)
    <br>
    <br>Here Tsender is the amount of tokens of the caller of the function and ΞDAO is the balance of the DAO at the time of the split.
    <br>This will be used to effectively create tokens in the newly created DAO and fuel the new DAO just as the original DAO was fueled.
    <br>In addition to the ether which is moved to the new DAO, the reward tokens Rsender are also transferred.
    <br>They are calculated as follows:
    <br>
    <br><img src="filMcsDtcnet.files/imgEthddwprEqn5.png"> (eqn.5)
    <br>
    <br>Where RDAO is the amount of reward tokens owned by the original DAO at the time of the split.
    <br>These tokens allow the new DAO to retrieve their portion of the reward using the retrieveDAOReward function of the original DAO.
    <br>At the end of this process all original DAO tokens of the sender account are destroyed.
    <br>It is important to notice that in all integer division descirbed above, there may be remainders which stay with the DAO.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P49"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P50">newContract. This function can only be called by the DAO itself (through a proposal and a vote) and is used to move all remaining ether, as well as all rewardTokens to a new address.
    <br>This is used to update the contract.
    <br>The new address needs to be approved by the Curator.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P50"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P51">transfer and transferFrom. These functions overload the functions defined in the Token contract.
    <br>They do call transfer / transferFrom function in the Token contract, but they additionally transfer information about the already paid out rewards attached to the tokens being transferred using the transferPaidOut function.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P51"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P52">transferPaidOut. This function is called when making any transfer of DAO tokens using transfer or transferFrom and it updates the array paidOut to track the amount of rewards which has been paid out already, P, and is calculated as follows:
    <br>
    <br><img src="filMcsDtcnet.files/imgEthddwprEqn6.png"> (eqn.6)
    <br>
    <br>Here Pfrom is the total amount of ether which has been paid out to the from address (the sender), Tamount is the amount of tokens to be transferred and Tfrom is the amount of tokens owned by the from address.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P52"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P53">transferWithoutReward and transferFromWithoutReward.
    <br>The same as transfer and transferFrom, but it calls getMyReward prior to that.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P53"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P54">getMyReward. Calls withdrawRewardFor with the sender as the parameter.
    <br>This is used to withdraw the portion of the rewards which belong to the sender from the rewardAccount.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P54"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P55">withdrawRewardFor. This function is used to retrieve the portion of the rewards in the rewardAccount which belong to the address given as a parameter.
    <br>The amount of ether Ξreward which is then sent to the DAO token holder that
    <br>calls this function is:
    <br>
    <br><img src="filMcsDtcnet.files/imgEthddwprEqn7.png"> (eqn.7)
    <br>
    <br>Here ΞrewardAccount is the total rewards ever received by the rewardAccount and ΞpaidOut[sender] is the total amount of wei which has already been paid out to the DAO token holder address, which is given as a parameter.
    <br>The reward tokens are further elaborated in section 8.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P55"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P56">retrieveDAOReward. This function, when called by a DAO, sends the rewards which belong to this DAO from DAOrewardAccount to either the DAO itself, or to the rewardAccount of the respective DAO in order to be distributed among its token holders, depending on the parameter _toMembers.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P56"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P57">changeAllowedRecipients. This function can add/remove an address to/from the whitelist, allowedRecipients.
    <br>It can only be executed by the Curator.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P57"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P58">halveMinQuorum. When called, halves the minimum quorum in the case it has not been met for over 52 weeks, by doubling minQuorumDivisor.
    <br>Also the curator can call this function without the 52 weeks limit, but not more than once every other week.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P58"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P59">numberOfProposals. Returns the total number of proposals ever created.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P59"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P60">getNewDAOAdress. This is just a helper function to read the address of a newly created ‘split DAO‘.
    <br>It gets the proposal ID which was used for the split as input parameter and returns the address of the new DAO.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P60"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P61">isBlocked. This function returns true when the address given as parameter is currently blocked to transfer tokens due to an ongoing vote it has participated in, otherwise it returns false.
    <br>It also unblocks the tokens in the case the voting deadline of the proposal is over.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P61"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P62">unblockMe. Calling isBlocked with the address of the sender.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr7H4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idEthddwpr7P1">This section gives a description of how reward tokens are implemented in this contract.
    <br>Much of the information has already been explained, but it is restated here for clarity.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr7P1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr7P2">Reward tokens are used to divide the ether sent to DAOrewardAccount amongst the various DAOs that own reward tokens.
    <br>Reward tokens are only transferred in the event of a DAO split or an update of the contract, they can never be owned by anything other than the original DAO or a fork of the original DAO that generated the reward tokens.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr7P2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr7P3">Reward tokens are generated when the DAO makes any transaction spending ether.
    <br>When the DAOs products send ether back to the DAO, the ether is held within DAOrewardAccount.
    <br>The DAO can use these rewards to fund new proposals or to fairly distribute the rewards to the reward token holders (using a proposal which gets voted on by the DAO token holders).
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr7P3"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr7P4">Then the token holders of the DAOs will be able to claim the ether they have earned for their contribution to the original DAO that issued the reward token.
    <br>To do this the DAO retrieve its rewards by callling the retrieveDAOReward function, with the paramter _toMembers set to true, which send the rewards to the rewardAccount (a ManagedAccount contract) and keeps track of the payouts in DAOpaidOut.
    <br>Then and only then will the token holders of the DAOs be able to call the getMyReward function and receive their ether.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr7P4"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr7P5">These payouts are tracked by the map paidOut which keeps track of which token holders have claimed their fair portion of the rewards.
    <br>This process guarantees that any DAO token holder whose ether was spent building a product will receive the rewards promised to them from that product even if they decide to split from the DAO.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr8H4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idEthddwpr8P1">This section formally describes a few important parameters and their behavior during a split.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr8P1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr8P2">The total amount of DAO tokens totalSupply is defined as follows:
    <br>
    <br><img src="filMcsDtcnet.files/imgEthddwprEqn8.png"> (eqn.8)
    <br>
    <br>Where Ti is the amount of DAO tokens owned by an address i (balances[i]).
    <br>Note that 2^256 is the total number of possible addresses in Ethereum.
    <br>Similarly, the amount of reward tokens Rtotal is defined as follows:
    <br>
    <br><img src="filMcsDtcnet.files/imgEthddwprEqn9.png"> (eqn.9)
    <br>
    <br>For every passed proposal that sends ether out of the DAO, an amount of reward tokens equal to the amount being spent (in wei) is created.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr8P2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr8P3">Lets assume that during the split, a fraction of DAO tokens, X, changes the Curator and leaves the DAO.
    <br>The new DAO created receives X · ΞDAO pre, a portion of the remaining ether from the original DAO.
    <br>
    <br><img src="filMcsDtcnet.files/imgEthddwprEqn10.png"> (eqn.10)
    <br>
    <br>Here ΞDAO pre is the ether balance of the original DAO before the split and ΞDAO post is the ether balance of the original DAO after the split.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr8P3"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr8P4">A portion of the reward tokens is transferred to the new DAO in a very similar manner:
    <br>
    <br><img src="filMcsDtcnet.files/imgEthddwprEqn11.png"> (eqn.11)

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr9H4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idEthddwpr9P1">Although the code of the contract specified at a certain address in the Ethereum blockchain can not be changed, there might still be a need for a single member or the DAO as a whole to change the contracts.
    <br>Every single member can always split the DAO as described above and move their funds to a new DAO.
    <br>From there they can move their funds to another new DAO with a new smart contract.
    <br>But in order to use a new code for the complete DAO one can simply create a new DAO contract with all the needed features and deploy it on the blockchain, and make a proposal to call the newContract function with the address of the new contract as parameter.
    <br>If accepted, the complete DAO moves to the new contract, meaning, all ether and reward tokens are transferred to the new contract.
    <br>In order to use the same underlying DAO tokens there, one can use the approve function and give the new DAO the right to move the tokens.
    <br>In the new contract this right should only be usable in restricted functions which are only callable by the owner of the tokens.
    <br>Another option is to create new tokens in the new contract based on the token distribution in the old contract.
    <br>This can also be achieved by a proof that the old tokens are destroyed (sending to the 0 address).
    <br>This process allows for the DAO to maintain static immutable code on the Ethereum blockchain, while still being able to be updated if the need arises.

  <p id="idEthdapDaoThddsn">Description::
    <br>The DAO was[citation needed] a digital decentralized autonomous organization and a form of investor-directed venture capital fund.[5]
    <br>The DAO had an objective to provide a new decentralized business model for organizing both commercial and non-profit enterprises.[6][7] It was instantiated on the Ethereum blockchain, and had no conventional management structure or board of directors.[6] The code of the DAO is open-source.[8]
    <br>The DAO was stateless, and not tied to any particular nation state. As a result, many questions of how government regulators would deal with a stateless fund were yet to be dealt with.[9]
    <br>The DAO was crowdfunded via a token sale in May 2016. It set the record for the largest crowdfunding campaign in history.[5]
    <br>In June 2016, hackers exploited a vulnerability in the DAO code to enable them to siphon off one third of The DAO's funds to a subsidiary account. On the 20th July 2016, the Ethereum community decided to hard-fork the Ethereum blockchain to restore virtually all funds to the original contract.[10] This was controversial, and led to a fork in Ethereum, where the original unforked blockchain was maintained as Ethereum Classic, thus breaking Ethereum into two separate active cryptocurrencies.[11][12]

    <br>The specs were implemented by the client’s developers (including Geth, Parity, EthereumJ, Đ-Eth, etc) and the choice whether to fork or not was left to the community by using a switch when starting their client. At block 1920000 (on July 20th), the hard fork became active as a majority of miners and nodes moved to the new version of the chain. The hard fork worked smoothly.
    <br>Original DAO token holders started to withdraw their ETH, while the signatories of the curator multisig started to work on the edge cases (note: this is still a work in progress)
    <br>Surprisingly, the old chain did receive more support than expected. Exchanges listed the token of the old chain (under the name “Ether classic”), and blockchain explorers were created. Users found themselves confronted with the choice of two chains, which challenged the former Robin Hood Group to start the process of also returning the ETC, an ongoing process.

    <br>April 30, 2016 - May 28, 2016
    <br>Crowdsale Details
    <br>The DAO, a distributed autonomous organization and future client of Slock.it, is holding an ICO. It is not quite a crowdsale: the DAO is selling ownership of itself and raising ETH in the process. The DAO’s first act will be to hire Slock.it to do their work.
    <br>
    <br>How are funds collected?&nbsp; &nbsp; To obtain DAO tokens, follow the wizard here or send ETH from your Ethereum Wallet (NOT an exchange) to The DAO’s address, given on on the same page.
    <br>Coin Distribution&nbsp; &nbsp; All tokens will be distributed to those who contribute ETH. None are set aside for developers.
    <br>Escrow Used&nbsp; &nbsp; Unknown
    <br>Rate&nbsp; &nbsp; 100 DAO Tokens per ETH for the first 14 days (roughly $.08/token). Then a linear increase for the next 10 days. For last 14 days, 100 DAO Tokens per 1.5 ETH (roughly $.12/token)
    <br>Project Valuation&nbsp; &nbsp; Currently unknown, the valuation will be based on the amount of ETH raised.
    <br>Currencies used&nbsp; &nbsp; ETH
    <br>
    <br>How do the coins or tokens work?
    <br>How are they used?&nbsp; &nbsp; The tokens represent ownership over the DAO, which includes being able to nominate and vote on DAO activities, nominate and vote on DAO curators. At any point, token holders can burn their tokens and retrieve their unspent ETH. Read more about token holder abilities here.
    <br>What is the market for these coins?&nbsp; &nbsp; Any profits the DAO makes on its investments will be given back to token holders as dividends.
    <br>How are they produced?&nbsp; &nbsp; The only way future DAO tokens are created is through vote of the token holders.

    <br>We design and build KyberNetwork, an on-chain protocol which allows instant exchange and conversion of digital assets (e.g. crypto tokens) and cryptocurrencies (e.g. Ether, Bitcoin, ZCash) with high liquidity.
    <br>KyberNetwork will be the first system that implements several ideal operating properties of an exchange including trustless, decentralized execution, instant trade and high liquidity.
    <br>Besides serving as an exchange, KyberNetwork also provides payment APIs that will allow Ethereum accounts to easily receive payments from any crypto tokens.
    <br>As an example, any merchant can now use KyberNetwork APIs to allow users to pay in any crypto tokens, but the merchant will receive payments in Ether (ETH) or other preferred tokens.
    <br>Although running on the Ethereum network, KyberNetwork’s roadmap includes supporting cross-chain trades between different cryptocurrencies using relays and future protocols like Polkadot and Cosmos. Ethereum accounts will be able to safely receive payment from Bitcoin, ZCash and other cryptocurrencies via our payment APIs, through this trustless payment service.
    <br>Derivatives will be introduced to mitigate the exposure to the risk of volatilities for the users of KyberNetwork Crystals (KNC) and selected cryptocurrencies.
    <br>This will allow users to participate in the price movements synthetically.

The objective is to peer-to-peer storage and serving solution that is DDOS-resistant, zero-downtime, fault-tolerant and censorship-resistant as well as self-sustaining due to a built-in incentive system which uses peer to peer accounting and allows trading resources for payment.
    <br>Swarm is designed to deeply integrate with the devp2p multiprotocol network layer of Ethereum as well as with the Ethereum blockchain for domain name resolution, service payments and content availability insurance.

    <br>A Brief Overview
    <br>To use the WeiFund decentralized app (dApp), users will first open WeiFund in a web 3.0 enabled browser such as Ethereum's Mist.
    <br>A user would then immediately be able to start, contribute to, browse, and manage crowdfunding campaigns.
    <br>WeiFund's interface and user experience will be very similar to that of conventional crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter or GoFundMe, however, all funds raised on WeiFund will be accounted for in the Ether digital-currency.
    <br>Web 3.0 enabled browsers will come with their own wallet systems so that payments made on WeiFund to start and contribute to campaigns are done so in a secure and verifiable way.

    <br>The popular term “<strong>smart contracts</strong>” refers to <span class="clsBU">code</span> in <a class="clsPreview" href="#idEthactCrt">a Contract Account</a> – programs that execute when a transaction is sent to that account.

    <br>===
    <br>One way of thinking about smart contracts, and the way we’re going to think about them here, is as extremely basic, stateless web-services. Webservices are units of functionality in a system (the internet), with a well defined API and an identifier (IP address) that can be used to call them. Similarly, a smart contract is a unit of functionality, the public functions exposed by their Solidity contracts is the API, and their public address is the identifier. A web-service is normally called by making an http request, and a contract is called by making a transaction. Also, in most cases everyone is allowed to call them the endpoints are exposed to the public, so security must be handled on a call-by-call basis, and the same thing goes for contracts and their functions. We can even utilize common patterns and architectures, such as for example the microservices architecture.

    <br>“Contracts” in Ethereum should not be seen as something that should be “fulfilled” or “complied with”; rather, they are more like “autonomous agents” that live inside of the Ethereum execution environment, always executing a specific piece of code when “poked” by a message or transaction, and having direct control over their own ether balance and their own key/value store to store their permanent state.
    <br>[<a href="https://ethereum-homestead.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contracts-and-transactions/account-types-gas-and-transactions.html#contract-accounts">https://ethereum-homestead.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contracts-and-transactions/account-types-gas-and-transactions.html#contract-accounts</a>]
    <br>===
    <br>A contract is <strong>a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state)</strong> that <strong>resides</strong> at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain.
    <br>Contract accounts are able to pass messages between themselves as well as doing practically Turing complete computation.
    <br>Contracts live on the blockchain in a Ethereum-specific binary format called Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode.
    <br>Contracts are typically written in some high level language such as Solidity and then compiled into bytecode to be uploaded on the blockchain.

    <br>CT: Ethereum and smart contracts: Do you feel that in the real world it would be difficult to understand for lay people?
    <br>TG: I believe a large part of the misunderstanding with so-called smart contracts is that the name is partially a misnomer. Really what we're talking about is programs on blockchains. These programs can be coded to do just about anything, but have the added benefit of digital uniqueness without central point of failure. From this point, lots of things are possible from digital assets to autonomous assistants.

    <br>===
    <br>So far, all contracts we listed were owned and executed by other accounts probably held by humans. But there is no discrimination against robots or humans in the Ethereum ecosystem and contracts can create arbitrary actions like any other account would. Contracts can own tokens, participate in crowdsales, and even be voting members of other contracts.

    <br>Our <span class="clsBU">backend</span> (referred to as a ‘contract’ in Ethereum) is going to use a language called Solidity. There are several other contract languages you can use when building Ethereum backend, LLL (similar to Lisp) and Serpent (similar to Python). We’ll use Solidity as it is the formally supported language by the ETHDEV team.

    <br>The key property of a smart contract is simple: there is only <strong>a fixed number of parties</strong>.

    <br>Smart contracts can run on forever; hedging contracts and escrow contracts are good examples there.
    <br>However, smart contracts that run on forever should still have a fixed number of parties (eg. an entire decentralized exchange is not a smart contract), and contracts that are not intended to exist forever are smart contracts because existing for a finite time necessarily implies the involvement of a finite number of parties.

    <br>Smart-Contract Messages
    <br>Contracts have the ability to send “messages” to other contracts. Messages are virtual objects that are never serialized and exist only in the Ethereum execution environment.
    <br>
    <br>A message contains:
    <br>- sender: The sender of the message.
    <br>- recipient: The recipient of the message.
    <br>- amount: The amount of ether to transfer.
    <br>- data: An optional data field.
    <br>- startgas: A STARTGAS value.
    <br>
    <br>Essentially, a message is like a transaction, except it is produced by a contract and not an external actor. A message is produced when a contract currently executing code executes the CALL opcode, which produces and executes a message. Like a transaction, a message leads to the recipient account running its code. Thus, contracts can have relationships with other contracts in exactly the same way that external actors can.
    <br>[<a href="https://leanpub.com/decentralizedapplicationswithethereum/read_sample">https://leanpub.com/decentralizedapplicationswithethereum/read_sample</a>]
    <br>===
    <br>Message Calls
    <br>Contracts can call other contracts or send Ether to non-contract accounts by the means of message calls. Message calls are similar to transactions, in that they have a source, a target, data payload, Ether, gas and return data. In fact, every transaction consists of a top-level message call which in turn can create further message calls.
    <br>
    <br>A contract can decide how much of its remaining gas should be sent with the inner message call and how much it wants to retain. If an out-of-gas exception happens in the inner call (or any other exception), this will be signalled by an error value put onto the stack. In this case, only the gas sent together with the call is used up. In Solidity, the calling contract causes a manual exception by default in such situations, so that exceptions “bubble up” the call stack.
    <br>
    <br>As already said, the called contract (which can be the same as the caller) will receive a freshly cleared instance of memory and has access to the call payload - which will be provided in a separate area called the calldata. After it finished execution, it can return data which will be stored at a location in the caller’s memory preallocated by the caller.
    <br>
    <br>Calls are limited to a depth of 1024, which means that for more complex operations, loops should be preferred over recursive calls.
    <br>[<a href="http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.9/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#message-calls">http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.9/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#message-calls</a>]
    <br>===
    <br>What is a message?
    <br>Contracts have the ability to send “messages” to other contracts. Messages are virtual objects that are never serialized and exist only in the Ethereum execution environment. They can be conceived of as <strong>function calls</strong>.
    <br>A message contains:
    <br>- the sender of the message (implicit).
    <br>- the recipient of the message
    <br>- VALUE field - The amount of wei to transfer alongside the message to the contract address,
    <br>an optional data field, that is the actual input data to the contract
    <br>- a STARTGAS value, which limits the maximum amount of gas the code execution triggered by the message can incur.
    <br>Essentially, a message is like a transaction, except it is produced by a contract and not an external actor. A message is produced when a contract currently executing code executes the CALL or DELEGATECALL opcodes, which produces and executes a message. Like a transaction, a message leads to the recipient account running its code. Thus, contracts can have relationships with other contracts in exactly the same way that external actors can.

    <br>Contracts can even create other contracts using a special opcode (i.e. they do not simply call the zero address). The only difference between these create calls and normal message calls is that the payload data is executed and the result stored as code and the caller / creator receives the address of the new contract on the stack.

    <br>public:
    <br>Public functions are part of the contract interface and can be either <strong>called</strong> internally or via messages.
    <br>For public state variables, an automatic getter function (see below) is generated.
    <br>...
    <br>Functions can be specified as being external, public, internal or private, where the default is public.

    <br>===
    <br>The keyword public automatically generates a function that allows you to access the current value of the state variable. Without this keyword, other contracts have no way to access the variable. The function will look something like this:
    <br>function minter() returns (address) { return minter; }
    <br>Of course, adding a function exactly like that will not work because we would have a function and a state variable with the same name, but hopefully, you get the idea - the compiler figures that out for you.
    <br>... <strong>The getter function</strong> created by the public keyword is a bit more complex in this case. It roughly looks like the following:
    <br>function balances(address _account) returns (uint) {
    <br>    return balances[_account];
    <br>}

  <p id="idEthsolsutcvtgdsn">Description::
    <br>Type conversion
    <br>The compiler allows you to convert between types in certain cases. Let’s say you have the number 1 stored in a uint variable, and you want to use it in another variable of type int. That is possible - but you generally have to do the conversion yourself. This is how you would do it:
    <br>
    <br>uint x = 1;
    <br>int y = int(x);
    <br>
    <br>Type conversion is also checked at compile time and will generally be caught but there are exceptions; the most important one is when converting an address to a contract type. These type of casts can lead to bugs. We will be looking at some examples in a later section.

    <br>Finally, type conversion is something that should be used with care. It’s good in some cases, but excessive and/or careless casting is usually a sign that the code is not well written and can sometimes have bad consequences (such as data-loss). Remember types are there for a reason.

    <br>Complex types, i.e. types which do not always fit into 256 bits have to be handled more carefully than the value-types we have already seen.
    <br>Since copying them can be quite expensive, we have to think about whether we want them to be stored in memory (which is not persisting) or storage (where the state variables are held).

  <p id="idEthsolsutdtlndsn">Description::
    <br>Data location
    <br>Every complex type, i.e. arrays and structs, has an additional annotation, the “data location”, about whether it is stored in memory or in storage. Depending on the context, there is always a default, but it can be overridden by appending either storage or memory to the type. The default for function parameters (including return parameters) is memory, the default for local variables is storage and the location is forced to storage for state variables (obviously).
    <br>
    <br>There is also a third data location, “calldata”, which is a non-modifyable non-persistent area where function arguments are stored. Function parameters (not return parameters) of external functions are forced to “calldata” and it behaves mostly like memory.
    <br>
    <br>Data locations are important because they change how assignments behave: Assignments between storage and memory and also to a state variable (even from other state variables) always create an independent copy. Assignments to local storage variables only assign a reference though, and this reference always points to the state variable even if the latter is changed in the meantime. On the other hand, assignments from a memory stored reference type to another memory-stored reference type does not create a copy.

It is also common that some stages are automatically reached at a certain point in time.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthsoleH3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idEthsoledsn">Description::
    <br>Events are used to dump information from Solidity contract code into the blockchain clients log. It is a way of making that information available to the “outside world”. On top of the events themselves, most clients also have a way of capturing this output and encapsulating it in an event data-structures. This is particularly important for efficiency between the blockchain clients and the “outside world” which will rely upon these events in order for other things to happen.

    <br>===
    <br>event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value);
    <br>Next we specify an event, which is how in Solidity we use the logging facility of the Ethereum Virtual Machine. When called, events cause the arguments to be stored in the transaction’s log. In this instance we are storing three parameters, _from which is of type address, _to_ which is another address, and _value which is a uint256 (256-bit unsigned integer). Notice that _from and _to have an additional attribute indexed. This attribute causes those arguments to be treated as log topics, rather than data.

    <br>===
    <br>The line event Sent(address from, address to, uint amount); declares a so-called “event” which is fired in the last line of the function send. User interfaces (as well as server appliances of course) can listen for those events being fired on the blockchain without much cost.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthsolfFbkH4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idEthsolfFbkdsn">Description::
    <br>Fallback Function
    <br>A contract can have exactly <strong>one unnamed function</strong>. This function cannot have arguments and cannot return anything. It is executed on a call to the contract if none of the other functions matches the given function identifier (or if no data was supplied at all).
    <br>
    <br>Furthermore, this function is executed whenever the contract receives plain Ether (without data). In such a context, there is usually very little gas available to the function call (to be precise, 2300 gas), so it is important to make fallback functions as cheap as possible.
    <br>
    <br>In particular, the following operations will consume more gas than the stipend provided to a fallback function:
    <br>
    <br>Writing to storage
    <br>Creating a contract
    <br>Calling an external function which consumes a large amount of gas
    <br>Sending Ether
    <br>Please ensure you test your fallback function thoroughly to ensure the execution cost is less than 2300 gas before deploying a contract.
    <br>
    <br>Warning
    <br>
    <br>Contracts that receive Ether but do not define a fallback function throw an exception, sending back the Ether (this was different before Solidity v0.4.0). So if you want your contract to receive Ether, you have to implement a fallback function.

    <br>Libraries are similar to contracts, but their purpose is that they are deployed only once at a specific address and their code is reused using the DELEGATECALL (CALLCODE until Homestead) feature of the EVM. This means that if library functions are called, their code is executed in the context of the calling contract, i.e. this points to the calling contract, and especially the storage from the calling contract can be accessed. As a library is an isolated piece of source code, it can only access state variables of the calling contract if they are explicitly supplied (it would have no way to name them, otherwise).

  <p id="idEthsolmdsn">Description::
    <br>A mapping is a relational type, from keys to values,
    <br>[<a href="https://leanpub.com/decentralizedapplicationswithethereum/read_sample">https://leanpub.com/decentralizedapplicationswithethereum/read_sample</a>]
    <br>===
    <br>Mapping types are declared as mapping _KeyType => _ValueType, where _KeyType can be almost any type except for a mapping and _ValueType can actually be any type, including mappings.
    <br>
    <br>Mappings can be seen as hashtables which are virtually initialized such that every possible key exists and is mapped to a value whose byte-representation is all zeros. The similarity ends here, though: The key data is not actually stored in a mapping, only its sha3 hash used to look up the value.
    <br>
    <br>Because of this, mappings do not have a length or a concept of a key or value being “set”.
    <br>
    <br>Mappings are only allowed for state variables (or as storage reference types in internal functions).
    <br>[<a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.org/en/latest/types.html#mappings">https://solidity.readthedocs.org/en/latest/types.html#mappings</a>]

    <br>mapping (string => uint) public balances;
    <br>balances["charles"] = 1;
    <br>console.log(balances["ada"]); // is 0, all non-set key values return zeroes
    <br>// 'public' allows following from another contract
    <br>contractName.balances("charles"); // returns 1
    <br>// 'public' created a getter (but not setter) like the following:
    <br>function balances(string _account) returns (uint balance) {
    <br>    return balances[_account];
    <br>}

    <br>// Nested mappings

    <br>// To delete
    <br>delete balances["John"];

    <br>Integers in Solidity can be either signed or unsigned, and can be on the form intN/uintN, where N = 8*n for n = 1, 2, ... , 32. Some examples would be uint8, int32, int128, and uint240. Additionally, int and uint are shorthand for int256 and uint256, respectively.

    <br>int• / uint•: Signed and unsigned integers of various sizes. Keywords uint8 to uint256 in steps of 8 (unsigned of 8 up to 256 bits) and int8 to int256. uint and int are aliases for uint256 and int256, respectively.
    <br>
    <br>Operators:
    <br>Comparisons: &lt;=, &lt;, ==, !=, >=, > (evaluate to bool)
    <br>Bit operators: &, |, ^ (bitwise exclusive or), ~ (bitwise negation)
    <br>Arithmetic operators: +, -, unary -, unary +, *, /, % (remainder), ** (exponentiation)
    <br>Division always truncates (it just maps to the DIV opcode of the EVM), but it does not truncate if both operators are literals (or literal expressions).

  <p id="idEthsolstcImptdsn">Description::
    <br>Solidity supports import statements that are very similar to those available in JavaScript (from ES6 on), although Solidity does not know the concept of a “default export”.
    <br>
    <br>At a global level, you can use import statements of the following form:
    <br>
    <br>import "filename";
    <br>This statement imports all global symbols from “filename” (and symbols imported there) into the current global scope (different than in ES6 but backwards-compatible for Solidity).
    <br>
    <br>import * as symbolName from "filename";
    <br>...creates a new global symbol symbolName whose members are all the global symbols from "filename".
    <br>
    <br>import {symbol1 as alias, symbol2} from "filename";
    <br>...creates new global symbols alias and symbol2 which reference symbol1 and symbol2 from "filename", respectively.
    <br>
    <br>Another syntax is not part of ES6, but probably convenient:
    <br>
    <br>import "filename" as symbolName;
    <br>which is equivalent to import * as symbolName from "filename";.

  <p id="idEthsolstcImptpofdsn">Description::
    <br>Paths
    <br>In the above, filename is always treated as a path with / as directory separator, . as the current and .. as the parent directory. When . or .. is followed by a character except /, it is not considered as the current or the parent directory. All path names are treated as absolute paths unless they start with the current . or the parent directory ...
    <br>
    <br>To import a file x from the same directory as the current file, use import "./x" as x;. If you use import "x" as x; instead, a different file could be referenced (in a global “include directory”).
    <br>
    <br>It depends on the compiler (see below) how to actually resolve the paths. In general, the directory hierarchy does not need to strictly map onto your local filesystem, it can also map to resources discovered via e.g. ipfs, http or git.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthsolstcForH4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idEthsolstcFordsn">Description::
    <br>Using For
    <br>
    <br>The directive using A for B; can be used to attach library functions (from the library A) to any type (B). These functions will receive the object they are called on as their first parameter (like the self variable in Python).
    <br>
    <br>The effect of using A for *; is that the functions from the library A are attached to any type.
    <br>
    <br>In both situations, all functions, even those where the type of the first parameter does not match the type of the object, are attached. The type is checked at the point the function is called and function overload resolution is performed.
    <br>
    <br>The using A for B; directive is active for the current scope, which is limited to a contract for now but will be lifted to the global scope later, so that by including a module, its data types including library functions are available without having to add further code.
    <br>
    <br>Let us rewrite the set example from the Libraries in this way:
    <br>
    <br>pragma solidity ^0.4.0;
    <br>
    <br>// This is the same code as before, just without comments
    <br>library Set {
    <br>  struct Data { mapping(uint => bool) flags; }
    <br>
    <br>  function insert(Data storage self, uint value)
    <br>      returns (bool)
    <br>  {
    <br>      if (self.flags[value])
    <br>        return false; // already there
    <br>      self.flags[value] = true;
    <br>      return true;
    <br>  }
    <br>
    <br>  function remove(Data storage self, uint value)
    <br>      returns (bool)
    <br>  {
    <br>      if (!self.flags[value])
    <br>          return false; // not there
    <br>      self.flags[value] = false;
    <br>      return true;
    <br>  }
    <br>
    <br>  function contains(Data storage self, uint value)
    <br>      returns (bool)
    <br>  {
    <br>      return self.flags[value];
    <br>  }
    <br>}
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>contract C {
    <br>    using Set for Set.Data; // this is the crucial change
    <br>    Set.Data knownValues;
    <br>
    <br>    function register(uint value) {
    <br>        // Here, all variables of type Set.Data have
    <br>        // corresponding member functions.
    <br>        // The following function call is identical to
    <br>        // Set.insert(knownValues, value)
    <br>        if (!knownValues.insert(value))
    <br>            throw;
    <br>    }
    <br>}
    <br>It is also possible to extend elementary types in that way:
    <br>
    <br>pragma solidity ^0.4.0;
    <br>
    <br>library Search {
    <br>    function indexOf(uint[] storage self, uint value) returns (uint) {
    <br>        for (uint i = 0; i &lt; self.length; i++)
    <br>            if (self[i] == value) return i;
    <br>        return uint(-1);
    <br>    }
    <br>}
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>contract C {
    <br>    using Search for uint[];
    <br>    uint[] data;
    <br>
    <br>    function append(uint value) {
    <br>        data.push(value);
    <br>    }
    <br>
    <br>    function replace(uint _old, uint _new) {
    <br>        // This performs the library function call
    <br>        uint index = data.indexOf(_old);
    <br>        if (index == uint(-1))
    <br>            data.push(_new);
    <br>        else
    <br>            data[index] = _new;
    <br>    }
    <br>}
    <br>Note that all library calls are actual EVM function calls. This means that if you pass memory or value types, a copy will be performed, even of the self variable. The only situation where no copy will be performed is when storage reference variables are used.

    <br>Errors
    <br>There is no real error handling system in Solidity (yet). There are no try - catch or throw statements, or something to that effect. Contract designers need to deal with errors themselves. Solidity does some sanity checks on arrays and such, but will often respond simply by executing the (STOP) instruction. According to the developers, this is just put in as a placeholder until a more sophisticated error handling and recovery system is put in place.

  <div id="idEthsolSbtkndsn">
    <p>Description::
    <br>The following contract will implement the simplest form of a cryptocurrency. It is possible to generate coins out of thin air, but only the person that created the contract will be able to do that (it is trivial to implement a different issuance scheme). Furthermore, anyone can send coins to each other without any need for registering with username and password - all you need is an Ethereum keypair.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
pragma solidity ^0.4.0;

contract Coin {
    // The keyword "public" makes those variables
    // readable from outside.
    address public minter;
    mapping (address => uint) public balances;

    // Events allow light clients to react on
    // changes efficiently.
    event Sent(address from, address to, uint amount);

    // This is the constructor whose code is
    // run only when the contract is created.
    function Coin() {
        minter = msg.sender;
    }

    function mint(address receiver, uint amount) {
        if (msg.sender != minter) return;
        balances[receiver] += amount;
    }

    function send(address receiver, uint amount) {
        if (balances[msg.sender] &lt; amount) return;
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balances[receiver] += amount;
        Sent(msg.sender, receiver, amount);
    }
}
    </pre></code>
    <p class="clsIndent">This contract introduces some new concepts, let us go through them one by one.
    <br>
    <br>The line address public minter; declares a state variable of type address that is publicly accessible. The address type is a 160-bit value that does not allow any arithmetic operations. It is suitable for storing addresses of contracts or keypairs belonging to external persons. The keyword public automatically generates a function that allows you to access the current value of the state variable. Without this keyword, other contracts have no way to access the variable. The function will look something like this:
    <br>
    <br>function minter() returns (address) { return minter; }
    <br>Of course, adding a function exactly like that will not work because we would have a function and a state variable with the same name, but hopefully, you get the idea - the compiler figures that out for you.
    <br>
    <br>The next line, mapping (address => uint) public balances; also creates a public state variable, but it is a more complex datatype. The type maps addresses to unsigned integers. Mappings can be seen as hashtables which are virtually initialized such that every possible key exists and is mapped to a value whose byte-representation is all zeros. This analogy does not go too far, though, as it is neither possible to obtain a list of all keys of a mapping, nor a list of all values. So either keep in mind (or better, keep a list or use a more advanced data type) what you added to the mapping or use it in a context where this is not needed, like this one. The getter function created by the public keyword is a bit more complex in this case. It roughly looks like the following:
    <br>
    <br>function balances(address _account) returns (uint) {
    <br>    return balances[_account];
    <br>}
    <br>As you see, you can use this function to easily query the balance of a single account.
    <br>
    <br>The line event Sent(address from, address to, uint amount); declares a so-called “event” which is fired in the last line of the function send. User interfaces (as well as server appliances of course) can listen for those events being fired on the blockchain without much cost. As soon as it is fired, the listener will also receive the arguments from, to and amount, which makes it easy to track transactions. In order to listen for this event, you would use
    </p>
    <pre><code>
Coin.Sent().watch({}, '', function(error, result) {
    if (!error) {
        console.log("Coin transfer: " + result.args.amount +
            " coins were sent from " + result.args.from +
            " to " + result.args.to + ".");
        console.log("Balances now:\n" +
            "Sender: " + Coin.balances.call(result.args.from) +
            "Receiver: " + Coin.balances.call(result.args.to));
    }
}
    </code></pre>
    <p class="clsIndent">Note how the automatically generated function balances is called from the user interface.
    <br>
    <br>The special function Coin is the constructor which is run during creation of the contract and cannot be called afterwards. It permanently stores the address of the person creating the contract: msg (together with tx and block) is a magic global variable that contains some properties which allow access to the blockchain. msg.sender is always the address where the current (external) function call came from.
    <br>
    <br>Finally, the functions that will actually end up with the contract and can be called by users and contracts alike are mint and send. If mint is called by anyone except the account that created the contract, nothing will happen. On the other hand, send can be used by anyone (who already has some of these coins) to send coins to anyone else. Note that if you use this contract to send coins to an address, you will not see anything when you look at that address on a blockchain explorer, because the fact that you sent coins and the changed balances are only stored in the data storage of this particular coin contract. By the use of events it is relatively easy to create a “blockchain explorer” that tracks transactions and balances of your new coin.

    <br>Build System: Fixes to allow library compilation.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthsolEvgP10"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthsolEvgP11">eth-sol.0-4-0.2016-09-08:
    <br>This release <strong>deliberately breaks backwards compatibility</strong> mostly to enforce some safety features.
    <br>The most important change is that you have to explicitly specify if functions can receive ether via the payable modifier.
    <br>Furthermore, more situations cause exceptions to be thrown.
    <br>
    <br>Minimal changes to be made for upgrade:
    <br>Add payable to all functions that want to receive Ether (including the constructor and the fallback function).
    <br>Change _ to _; in modifiers.
    <br>Add version pragma to each file: pragma solidity ^0.4.0;
    <br>
    <br>Breaking Changes:
    <br>Source files have to specify the compiler version they are compatible with using e.g. pragma solidity ^0.4.0; or pragma solidity >=0.4.0 &lt;0.4.8;
    <br>Functions that want to receive Ether have to specify the new payable modifier (otherwise they throw).
    <br>Contracts that want to receive Ether with a plain "send" have to implement a fallback function with the payable modifier. Contracts now throw if no payable fallback function is defined and no function matches the signature.
    <br>Failing contract creation through "new" throws.
    <br>Division / modulus by zero throws.
    <br>Function call throws if target contract does not have code
    <br>Modifiers are required to contain _ (use if (false) _ as a workaround if needed).
    <br>Modifiers: return does not skip part in modifier after _.
    <br>Placeholder statement _ in modifier now requires explicit ;.
    <br>ecrecover now returns zero if the input is malformed (it previously returned garbage).
    <br>The constant keyword cannot be used for constructors or the fallback function.
    <br>Removed --interface (Solidity interface) output option
    <br>JSON AST: General cleanup, renamed many nodes to match their C++ names.
    <br>JSON output: srcmap-runtime renamed to srcmapRuntime.
    <br>Moved (and reworked) standard library contracts from inside the compiler to github.com/ethereum/solidity/std (import "std"; or import owned; do not work anymore).
    <br>Confusing and undocumented keyword after was removed.
    <br>New reserved words: abstract, hex, interface, payable, pure, static, view.
    <br>
    <br>Features:
    <br>Hexadecimal string literals: hex"ab1248fe"
    <br>Internal: Inline assembly usable by the code generator.
    <br>Commandline interface: Using - as filename allows reading from stdin.
    <br>Interface JSON: Fallback function is now part of the ABI.
    <br>Interface: Version string now semver compatible.
    <br>Code generator: Do not provide "new account gas" if we know the called account exists.
    <br>
    <br>Bugfixes:
    <br>JSON AST: Nodes were added at wrong parent
    <br>Why3 translator: Crash fix for exponentiation
    <br>Commandline Interface: linking libraries with underscores in their name.
    <br>Type Checker: Fallback function cannot return data anymore.
    <br>Code Generator: Fix crash when sha3() was used on unsupported types.
    <br>Code Generator: Manually set gas stipend for .send(0).
    <br>Lots of changes to the documentation mainly by voluntary external contributors.

  <p id="idEthsrptdsn">Description::
    <br>Serpent is a language similar to Python which can be used to develop contracts and compile to EVM bytecode. It is intended to be maximally clean and simple, combining many of the efficiency benefits of a low-level language with ease-of-use in programming style, and at the same time adding special domain-specific features for contract programming. Serpent is compiled using LLL.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthlllH2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idEthllldsn">Description::
    <br>LLL is a thin layer on top of the EVM that resembles Lisp. All EVM opcodes are available in LLL. On top of that it provides control structures (for, when, if, etc.) that are difficult and confusing to do in assembler. It also provides other convenient abstractions such a macros, and has the ability to include other source files as well.
    <br>[<a href="http://blog.syrinx.net/the-resurrection-of-lll-part-1/">http://blog.syrinx.net/the-resurrection-of-lll-part-1</a>/]

    <br>Lisp Like Language (LLL) is a low level language similar to Assembly. It is meant to be very simple and minimalistic; essentially just a tiny wrapper over coding in EVM directly.
    <br>LIBLLL in GitHub
    <br>Examples of LLL
    <br>[<a href="https://ethereum-homestead.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contracts-and-transactions/contracts.html#id4">https://ethereum-homestead.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contracts-and-transactions/contracts.html#id4</a>]
    <br>===
    <br>There does not appear to be active development on LLL as the Ethereum Foundation has identified Solidity as it's primary language that will receive development support from them. However, it is not "dead" in the sense that there are still bug fixes and small changes happening to the repository infrequently.
    <br>
    <br>Interesting side note: Inline ASM may be eventually supported in the Solidity Ethereum language.
    <br>
    <br>Vitalik Buterin said in Nov. 2015:
    <br>LLL was always meant to be very simple and minimalistic; essentially just a tiny wrapper over coding in ASM directly. In my opinion just use serpent; it has direct access to opcodes so it is a superset of LLL but it also has a whole bunch of high-level features as well for when you want them. The downside is that the compiler is more complex and so theoretically might contain more bugs.

    <br>Call stack depth limit [<a href="https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/6260/solidity-callstack-attack">https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/6260/solidity-callstack-attack</a>]: Don’t use recursion, and be aware that any call can fail if stack depth limit is reached.
    <br>Timestamp dependency [<a href="https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices#timestamp-dependence">https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices#timestamp-dependence</a>]: Do not use timestamps in critical parts of the code, because miners can manipulate them.
    <br>These are provided just as examples of unexpected behaviors that can lead for theft or destruction of funds in your smart contract. The morale is: if you’re writing smart contracts, you’re writing code that handles real money. You should be very careful! Write tests, do code reviews, and audit your code.

    <br>Dynamic Analysis is the process of executing code and data in real-time with the hope of finding issues during execution. It's a similar process to exploratory testing, with the same goals, but perhaps more technical.Dynamic analysis on the Ethereum blockchain has historically been costly at worst and tedious at best. If you were to perform dynamic analysis on the live Ethereum chain, transactions would cost you hard-earned Ether, which might limit the tests you perform. Moving away from the live chain is possible, but it's a tedious process to move the live data over to a separate chain, and you'd have to perform this process multiple times if you end up mucking with the chain state during testing.

    <br>Well, smart contract development is not a breeze, but it can be made much more efficient by the use of testrpc. Running a full Ethereum client (geth, eth, pyethapp, parity, etc.) can be a drain on a developer's resources, especially if running on an under-powered machine. Also, unless you set up a private network and tweak the settings, you have to wait a while for blocks to be mined before checking the results of your transactions. If you're connected to the main Homestead network you'll also be paying for your development testing with real digital currency. No, it's better to start simply and install ethereumjs/testrpc. Go ahead and follow the instructions in the README file to install it on your local machine.

    <br>Finally, before we get started it is important to know this: Writing smart contracts can be tricky. The transition from normal code writing to smart contract writing is not seamless. The environment in which smart contract code runs is different from that of normal code. The analogy with webservices is good, because it makes smart contracts and systems of smart contracts more tangible, and it makes it simpler to use already existing concepts and tools when working with them, but writing the actual code is still difficult.

The only difference between these create calls and normal message calls is that the payload data is executed and the result stored as code and the caller / creator receives the address of the new contract on the stack.

    <br>Ethereum contracts are stored in special contract accounts, and the contract code is executed when the account is the target of a (successful) transaction.
    <br>If I, as a user, want to execute a contract, I first need to find out the address to the account in which the contract is stored, and then transact to it.
    <br>The parameters for a transaction are:
    <br>The gas-price I want to pay (gasPrice).
    <br>The maximum amount of gas that may be spent (gas).
    <br>The amount of ether I want to transfer (value).
    <br>My account address (from).
    <br>The target account address (to).
    <br>The nonce (nonce).
    <br>The transaction data (data).
    <br>Alternatively, it is possible to create the transaction object itself on the caller side, sign it locally, and pass in the signed bytes.
    <br>The parameters used above is used when making RPC calls, and the client will then create (and sign) the transaction object for you.
    <br>Anyways, if my transaction is valid, the Ethereum client will put that transaction data into a context, along with the current block data and some other things.
    <br>It then passes the code of the contract account and the context into a new instance of the EVM, and execute it.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthctpupdtgH3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idEthctpupdtgdsn">Description::
    <br>Introduction
    <br>This tutorial series looks at modular systems of smart-contracts, and how to continuously update the code in a reliable way. Most contracts in your application will become obsolete at some point, and will require an update. Same as in other applications. It could be because new features must be added, a bug is found, or because a better, more optimized version has been made. Updating could of course cause problems so it must be done with care. Some of the things one must ensure is that:
    <br>- updating is possible.
    <br>- the new contract works as intended.
    <br>- all the calls made during the replacement procedure was executed successfully.
    <br>- replacing the contract has no side-effects in other parts of the system.
    <br>The first point may seem obvious but it usually requires a lot of work, because updating is not possible by default; the reason is because of how accounts, code and storage works.
    <br>
    <br>Accounts, Code and Storage
    <br><strong>A very important property of EVM contracts is that when a contract has been uploaded to the chain, the code can never be changed</strong>. Contracts are stored in special account objects, and these object has references to the contract (byte) code, and a database, and some other things. The database is a key-value store, also known as ‘storage’, and is where data such as the values of contract fields is stored.
    <br>
    <br>When contracts are created, a new account is first made, then the code is loaded into a VM which runs the constructor part, initializes fields etc., and then adds the runtime portion (or body) of the contract to the account. After that is done, there is no way to change the code, and there is no way to update the database except through that code.
    <br>
    <br>But what if you want to change the code? What if a bug is discovered?
    <br>
    <br>The way you solve that is by connecting several contracts. Contract C could call contract D as part of its functionality, and the address to D could be settable in C, meaning it would be possible to change what D is. This is best explained through a series of simple examples.
    <br>
    <br>A simple storage contract
    <br>contract Data {
    <br>
    <br>    uint public data;
    <br>
    <br>    function addData(uint data_) {
    <br>        if(msg.sender == 0x692a70d2e424a56d2c6c27aa97d1a86395877b3a)
    <br>            data = data_;
    <br>    }
    <br>
    <br>}
    <br>This simple contract allows a user to add and read an unsigned integer. The only account that is allowed to add data is the account with address 0x692a.... This address is a hex literal, so is added to the bytecode when the contract is compiled.
    <br>
    <br>A potential problem is that we might want to replace this address later, or even the entire validation procedurer, but we can’t because of how code and storage works. A simple way of making the contract more flexible is to store the current owner address in storage instead, and make it possible to change.
    <br>
    <br>contract DataOwnerSettable {
    <br>
    <br>    uint public data;
    <br>
    <br>    address public owner = msg.sender;
    <br>
    <br>    function addData(uint data_) {
    <br>        if(msg.sender == owner)
    <br>            data = data_;
    <br>    }
    <br>
    <br>    function setOwner(address owner_) {
    <br>        if(msg.sender == owner)
    <br>            owner = owner_;
    <br>    }
    <br>
    <br>}
    <br>This contract has an owner field (mapped to storage). It is initialized with the address of the account that creates the contract, and can later be changed by the current owner by calling setOwner. The guard inside addData is still the same; the only thing that changed is that the owner address is no longer hard-coded.
    <br>
    <br>Delegation
    <br>What if a settable owner is not enough, though? What if we want to be able to update not only the owner address, but the entire validation process? That is possible. We will do it in two steps. First we move the account validation code into a different contract.
    <br>
    <br>contract AccountValidator {
    <br>
    <br>    address public owner = msg.sender;
    <br>
    <br>    function validate(address addr) constant returns (bool) {
    <br>        return addr == owner;
    <br>    }
    <br>
    <br>    function setOwner(address owner_) {
    <br>        if(msg.sender == owner)
    <br>           owner = owner_;
    <br>    }
    <br>
    <br>}
    <br>
    <br>contract DataExternalValidation {
    <br>
    <br>    uint public data;
    <br>
    <br>    AccountValidator _validator;
    <br>
    <br>    function DataExternalValidation(address validator) {
    <br>        _validator = AccountValidator(validator);
    <br>    }
    <br>
    <br>    function addData(uint data_) {
    <br>        if(_validator.validate(msg.sender))
    <br>            data = data_;
    <br>    }
    <br>
    <br>    function setValidator(address validator) {
    <br>        if(_validator.validate(msg.sender))
    <br>            _validator = AccountValidator(validator);
    <br>    }
    <br>}
    <br>To use this, we first create an AccountValidator contract; it has the owner field now, and that field is automatically initialized with an account address. Then we create a DataExternalValidation-contract and inject the address of the validator through the contract constructor. When someone tries to write to data, it will call the validate function of the current validator contract to do the check rather then storing (or hard coding) the owner address and doing the equality check internally. Everything that has to do with access control is now delegated to the validator contract.
    <br>
    <br>This is very nice, because it is now possible to replace the contract that does the actual check. Not only does it decouple this from the data, but since the AccountValidator is its own contract, we could potentially use that contract in other contracts as well and thus give owner control over more contracts then just one.
    <br>
    <br>One thing remains though. We still can’t replace the code! All we have done is move the validation code out of the contract. The code of the AccountValidator contract can’t be changed anymore then that of the data contract. Fortunately, Solidity provides a very simple and powerful workaround - abstract functions.
    <br>
    <br>Abstract Functions
    <br>Using abstract functions, the validator contract could be changed into this:
    <br>
    <br>contract AccountValidator {
    <br>    function validate(address addr) constant returns (bool);
    <br>}
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>contract SingleAccountValidator is AccountValidator {
    <br>
    <br>    address public owner = msg.sender;
    <br>
    <br>    function validate(address addr) constant returns (bool) {
    <br>        return addr == owner;
    <br>    }
    <br>
    <br>    function setOwner(address owner_) {
    <br>        if(msg.sender == owner)
    <br>            owner = owner_;
    <br>    }
    <br>
    <br>}
    <br>With these contracts, the data contract no longer works with a concrete validator contract, but an abstract (interface) representation. This makes sense, because it does not really needs to know what the validate function actually does, it only needs to know the signature.
    <br>
    <br>Interfaces works the same way as it does in most other object-oriented languages, just declare functions without a body and they become abstract.
    <br>
    <br>We still can’t change the code stored in a contract account, but we can change the code that is executed when a function is called, by delegating some functionality to other contract which are allowed to be replaced; all we need to do is change the validator contract to a different contract. For example, if we want to allow more owners then one we could use an instance of this contract:
    <br>
    <br>contract MultiAccountValidator is AccountValidator {
    <br>
    <br>    mapping(address => bool) public owners;
    <br>
    <br>    function MultiAccountValidator() {
    <br>        owners[msg.sender] = true;
    <br>    }
    <br>
    <br>    function validate(address addr) constant returns (bool) {
    <br>        return owners[addr];
    <br>    }
    <br>
    <br>    function addOwner(address addr) {
    <br>        if(owners[msg.sender])
    <br>            owners[addr] = true;
    <br>    }
    <br>}
    <br>Summary
    <br>Proper delegation is an important part of smart-contract systems. It is also something one has to consider from the very start, because the rules for how a set of contracts can be updated is generally contained in the contracts themselves. Also, the more contracts that are in the system the harder they become to manage, and a strategy that makes a small system work may not be suitable for a medium-sized or large one.
    <br>
    <br>Another thing to keep in mind is that modularity comes with a cost, because it requires more code, storage variables and calls. On the public chain, where the gas limitations are quite severe (for obvious reasons), even a small modular system could be hard to deploy and run. Generally, when it comes to scalability vs. efficiency I tend to go with scalability. The large, expensive contracts in an excessively modular system can after all be improved and replaced, but if the contracts are locked down that may not be an option.
    <br>
    <br>In our opinion, it is very important to at least acknowledge that the code is going to need updates, and at some point there must be a good policy for how it can be done. The alternative is to not have a plan and fail. And then maybe fail again, and again, until eventually it becomes clear.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthctprmvgH3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idEthctprmvgdsn">Description::
    <br>The HelloSystem contract can be deployed as-is without any problems, but once it’s been deployed it will remain on the chain for good. We need a way to remove it. In Solidity, the command for removing (or suiciding) a contract is this: selfdestruct(addr). The argument here is the address to which any remaining funds should be sent. In order to expose this functionality, we need to put it inside a (implicitly public) function. This is what a selfdestruct function could look like in HelloSystem:
    <br>
    <br>contract HelloSystem {
    <br>    function remove() {
    <br>        selfdestruct(msg.sender);
    <br>    }
    <br>}
    <br>What this would do is to remove the contract when the remove function is called, and it would return any funds it may have to the caller. Needless to say, this is not ideal. Normally when you add a selfdestruct function you want to restrict the access to it. The simplest way of doing it is to store the address of the contract creator when the contract is deployed, and only allow the creator to call selfdestruct on it. Here is how that could be implemented:
    <br>
    <br>contract HelloSystem {
    <br>
    <br>    address owner;
    <br>
    <br>    // Constructor
    <br>    function HelloSystem(){
    <br>        owner = msg.sender;
    <br>    }
    <br>
    <br>    function remove() {
    <br>        if (msg.sender == owner){
    <br>            selfdestruct(owner);
    <br>        }
    <br>    }
    <br>
    <br>}
    <br>Note that msg.sender is not the same in the constructor as it is in the remove function. The constructor is called when the contract is added, so msg.sender will be the contract creator, but in all other functions it will be the address of the account that is calling it.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthctpOn5tmH2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idEthctpOn5tmSpc">Specific::
    <br>There are many different ways to classify contracts, but we’re going to use what I call “the five types model”. It is a simple model where contracts are divided up into five basic categories:
    <br>
    <br>1) Database contracts
    <br>These are used only as data storage. The only logic they need is functions that allow other contracts to write, update and get data, and some simple way of checking caller permissions (whatever those permissions may be).
    <br>
    <br>2) Controller contracts
    <br>These contracts operate on the storage contracts. In a flexible system, both controllers and databases can be replaced by other, similar contracts that share the same public api (although this is not always needed). Controllers can be advanced, and could for example do batched reads/writes, or read from and write to multiple different databases instead of just one.
    <br>
    <br>3) Contract managing contracts (CMCs)
    <br>The purpose of these contracts is only to manage other contracts. Their main tasks is to keep track of all the contracts/components of the system, handle the communication between these components, and to make modular design easier. Keeping this functionality separate from normal business logic should be considered good practice, and has a number of positive effects on the system (as we will see later).
    <br>
    <br>4) Application logic contracts (ALCs)
    <br>Application logic contracts contains application-specific code. Generally speaking, if the contract utilizes controllers and other contracts to perform application specific tasks it’s an ALC.
    <br>
    <br>5) Utility contracts
    <br>These type of contracts usually perform a specific task, and can be called by other contracts without restrictions. It could be a contract that hashes strings using some algorithm, provide random numbers, or other things. They normally don’t need a lot of storage, and often have few or no dependencies.
    <br>
    <br>The rationale for this division will be laid out after we’ve tried to apply it to the fund manager system, as it will be a lot more clear then.

    <br>Here is just one example: imagine you own a small business with your friends. Lawyers and accountants are expensive, and trusting a single partner to oversee the books can be a source of tension (even an opportunity for fraud). Complying strictly with a system in which more than one partner oversees the books can be trying and is subject to fraud whenever the protocol isn’t followed exactly.

    <br>Using a smart contract, ownership in your company and terms for the disbursal of funds can be specified at the outset. The smart contract can be written such that it is only changeable given the approval of a majority of owners. Smart contracts like these will likely be available as open source software, so you won’t even need to hire your own programmer in stead of an accountant/lawyer.
    <br>
    <br>A smart contract like this scales instantly. A couple of teenagers can split revenue from a lemonade stand just as transparently as a sovereign wealth fund can disburse funds to the hundred million citizens who are entitled to it. In both cases the price of this transparency is likely to be fractions of a penny per dollar.

If A agrees, the funds are released. If B decides not to finish the website, B can quit by sending a message to relinquish the funds. If B claims that he finished the website, but A does not agree, then after a 7-day waiting period it’s up to judge J to provide a verdict in A or B’s favor.

  <p id="idEthctpNmrgrdsn">Description::
    <br>Name registry, or “namereg” contracts generally lets people associate <strong>a name</strong> with <strong>an user account address</strong>. This is an example of such a contract:
    <br>
    <br>contract Users {
    <br>    // Here we store the names. Make it public to automatically generate an
    <br>    // accessor function named 'users' that takes a fixed-length string as argument.
    <br>    mapping (bytes32 => address) public users;
    <br>
    <br>    // Register the provided name with the caller address.
    <br>    // Also, we don't want them to register "" as their name.
    <br>    function register(bytes32 name) {
    <br>        if(users[name] == 0 && name != ""){
    <br>            users[name] = msg.sender;
    <br>        }
    <br>    }
    <br>
    <br>    // Unregister the provided name with the caller address.
    <br>    function unregister(bytes32 name) {
    <br>        if(users[name] != 0 && name != ""){
    <br>            users[name] = 0x0;
    <br>        }
    <br>    }
    <br>}
    <br>When this contract is called, it will use msg.sender and a provided name as parameters. msg.sender refers to the address of the account that made the transaction. name is a fixed-length string that the sender includes in the transaction data. If the name is not already taken, it will be written into users.
    <br>
    <br>This is a very basic but useful contract. It lets you refer to users by name instead of having to use their public address. It could be used as a basis for almost anything. It could use some more functionality, such as being able to list all the registered users, and maybe also make it possible to get a name by address, and not just address by name, and other things.

  <h2 id="idEthhmnBtnVtkH2">Đ-Eth-hmn.Buterin.Vitalik.1994 (hmnBtnVtk founder)
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthhmnBtnVtkH2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idEthhmnBtnVtkdsn">Description::
    <br>I was born in 1994 in Russia and moved to Canada in 2000, where I went to school. I went to the Abelard school in 2008 and entered the University of Waterloo in 2012, but quickly left in order to go on a six-month journey around the world and simultaneously engage in cryptocurrency-related projects on a full-time basis. The result of the journey was the idea behind Ethereum, a concept for <strong>a generalized cryptoeconomically secured state machine architecture</strong>, for which I continue to serve as Chief Scientist.
    <br>
    <br>My primary academic interest consists of studying and exploring the complicated intersection between information theory, cryptography, sociology, epistemology, politics and economics, where mechanisms such as prediction markets, cryptoeconomic state machines (for the layman: "blockchains"), security deposits, consumer protection and reputation systems, multi-key personal security architectures and sampling-and-fallback scalability games sit at the core.
    <br>
    <br>In general, I am trying to move beyond just being "a cryptocurrency person" and acquiring a more holistic and long-tail perspective of what role technology can play in helping to build more secure and trustworthy systems and reduce inefficiency and waste in society; I find that individuals that identify themselves around a particular solution (eg. cryptocurrency, progressivism, authoritarianism, libertarianism, radical decentralization) are likely to be more susceptible to confirmation biases and generally less interesting than people who identity themselves around a problem, and dedicate themselves to the search for a solution to that problem no matter where the search takes them.
    <br>
    <br>I also enjoy learning languages (started Mandarin a year ago) and exploring interesting places like the one that's the background of this screen.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthhmnWodGvnH2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idEthhmnWodGvndsn">Description::
    <br>Since my childhood economics and game theory have always interested me, even to the point of co-publishing a strategy board game of my own design. When I first read about Bitcoin in 2011, I was largely uninterested, focusing too much on the currency aspect rather than the technology. However, when I revisited it in early 2013, I began to realise new possibilities opening up between the fields of ITC and game theory, and the inevitable social change to which this would lead. A mutual friend made the introduction to Vitalik in late 2014 and Ethereum has dominated my life since.
    <br>I coded the first functional implementation of Ethereum and wrote the Yellow Paper, the first formal specification of any blockchain protocol and one of the key ways Ethereum separates itself from other blockchain-based systems. My original ideas for web three date back to early 2013, but my first post on the topic was in April 2014, later followed by a less-techy version.
    <br>Prior to Ethereum, I accrued a masters degree and doctorate in computer science. I consulted for Microsoft Reseach on technical aspects of embedded domain-specific languages, designed and implemented the first truly smart lighting controller for one of London's top nightclubs, designed and implemented most of the world's first C++ language workbench, and built the software systems of OxLegal, a smart text contract-editor.

    <br>Slock.it UG is a German company building the future infrastructure of the sharing economy. Our first product, the Ethereum Computer, brings blockchain technology to the entire home, making it possible to rent access to any compatible smart object and accept payments without intermediaries. We aim for this product and its ecosystem to be funded by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), a type of digital company or trust where token holders benefit financially from the revenue of the products they supported - think of it as a Kickstarter on steroids.
    <br>The DAO model is free and open source for anyone to reproduce and study, and our white paper can be downloaded here.
    <br>Slock.it UG will soon make the Ethereum Computer proposal to the DAO available to the public. Once ready, it will be posted on this website.

  <p id="idEthevlnP1">Nick Szabo ?@NickSzabo4  7m7 minutes ago
    <br>Ethereum can solve any problem a computer can solve: but with far greater reliability and security and far less performance and efficiency.
    <br>[2016-02-10]
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthevlnP1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthevlnP2">This massive parallelisation of computing across the entire Ethereum network is not done to make computation more efficient. In fact, this process makes computation on Ethereum far slower and more expensive than on a traditional “computer”. Rather, every Ethereum node runs the EVM in order to maintain consensus across the blockchain. Decentralized consensus gives Ethereum extreme levels of fault tolerance, ensures zero downtime, and makes data stored on the blockchain forever unchangeable and censorship-resistant.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthevlnP2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthevlnP3">One issue with Bitcoin, being a hardwired protocol, is that you can’t easily introduce many competing currency models on the same platform, and we know how hard it is to create a new network for each new protocol and a system to easily exchange value between networks, hence why softwired platforms like Ethereum are enticing – sure Ether’s issuance algorithm is fixed, but it is trivial to create almost an unlimited number of alternative easily exchangable currency models on the same platform without incurring the cost of creating a brand new network every time. Exciting times!

    <br>In general, there are three types of applications on top of Ethereum.
    <br><strong>The first category</strong> is financial applications, providing users with more powerful ways of managing and entering into contracts using their money.
    <br>This includes sub-currencies, financial derivatives, hedging contracts, savings wallets, wills, and ultimately even some classes of full-scale employment contracts.
    <br><strong>The second category</strong> is semi-financial applications, where money is involved but there is also a heavy non-monetary side to what is being done; a perfect example is self-enforcing bounties for solutions to computational problems.
    <br><strong>Finally</strong>, there are applications such as online voting and decentralized governance that are not financial at all.
    <br>[<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper#applications">https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper#applications</a>]
    <br>===
    <br>The Ethereum platform itself is featureless or value-agnostic.
    <br>Similar to programming languages, it is up to entrepreneurs and developers to decide what it should be used for.
    <br>However, it is clear that certain application types benefit more than others from Ethereum’s capabilities.
    <br>Specifically, ethereum is suited for applications that automate direct interaction between peers or facilitate coordinated group action across a network.
    <br>For instance, applications for coordinating peer-to-peer marketplaces, or the automation of complex financial contracts.
    <br>Bitcoin allows for individuals to exchange cash without involving any middlemen like financial institutions, banks, or governments.
    <br>Ethereum’s impact may be more far-reaching.
    <br>In theory, financial interactions or exchanges of any complexity could be carried out automatically and reliably using code running on Ethereum.
    <br>Beyond financial applications, any environments where trust, security, and permanence are important – for instance, asset-registries, voting, governance, and the internet of things – could be massively impacted by the Ethereum platform.

    <br>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum</a>]
    <br>===
    <br>Driving Factors.
    <br>There are many goals of this project; one key goal is to facilitate transactions between consenting individuals who would otherwise have no means to trust one another.
    <br>This may be due to geographical separation, interfacing difficulty, or perhaps the incompatibility, incompetence, unwillingness, expense, uncertainty, inconvenience or corruption of existing legal systems.
    <br>By specifying <strong>a state-change system</strong> through a rich and unambiguous language, and furthermore architecting a system such that we can reasonably expect that an agreement will be thus enforced autonomously, we can provide a means to this end.
    <br>Dealings in this proposed system would have several attributes not often found in the real world.
    <br>The incorruptibility of judgement, often difficult to find, comes naturally from a disinterested algorithmic interpreter.
    <br>Transparency, or being able to see exactly how a state or judgement came about through the transaction log and rules or instructional codes, never happens perfectly in humanbased systems since natural language is necessarily vague, information is often lacking, and plain old prejudices are difficult to shake.
    <br>Overall, I wish to provide a system such that users can be guaranteed that no matter with which other individuals, systems or organisations they interact, they can do so with absolute confidence in the possible outcomes and how those outcomes might come about.

    <br>The Morden testnet has been running since the launch of the Ethereum blockchain (July 2015). At that time, concerns about replay-attacks between Morden and Mainnet were addressed by using a nonce-offset. All accounts on Morden used a starting nonce of 2^20 instead of 0, ensuring that any transaction valid on one chain would not be valid on the other.

    <br>Morden
    <br>Morden is a name for one of the most popular public Ethereum TestNets. It is the same as the Ethereum network, but ETH on Morden is worth nothing. You can get ETH for free on Morden from many Morden "ETH faucets".

    <br>Before the current hard forks, there were already discussions about restarting the test network from a new genesis block in order to make full syncing simpler and less resource intensive. And due to the low difficulty of the testnet, the difficulty bomb was already causing noticeable increases in block times, which would continue to grow if unaddressed. So the time is now right to leave Morden behind and start a new test network.

    <br>The partial price and market cap recovery can be traced to Ethereum’s successful hard fork. The fork was agreed upon in response to the DAO hack, which resulted in the theft of a large amount of Ether. A proposed hard fork in the currency, isolating the stolen funds and rendering them without value, was readily agreed to by the Ethereum mining community and subsequently implemented, restoring confidence, and with it, value.
    <br>Additionally, cryptocurrency exchange/wallet provider/merchant solution Coinbase recently announced Ethereum integration, solidifying the currency’s place as being respected by the cryptocurrency “establishment.”

The results of the sale were initially used to pay back mounting legal debts and also for the months of developer effort that had yet to be compensated, and to finance the ongoing development of the Ethereum.

    <br>Many of these took the form of “alt coins” - separate blockchains with cryptocurrencies of their own which improved on the original bitcoin protocol to add new features or capabilities.
    <br>In late 2013, Ethereum’s inventor Vitalik Buterin proposed that a single blockchain with the capability to be reprogrammed to perform any arbitrarily complex computation could subsume these many other projects.

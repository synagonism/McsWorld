    <br>Organization is a-system-of-humans with an-administering-system.
    <br>IF it has-no administering-system, it is a-GROUP.
    <br>No humans, no group, no organization, no Dao.
    <br>A-blockchain-network only if it will add an-administering-system is becoming organization.
    <br>Bitcoin, Ethereum networks do-not have such a-system and have a-tendency to split.
    <br>BitShares clearly states in its whitepaper that it is a-Dao-company (as it runs for profit).
    <br>"<strong>BitShares is a decentralized autonomous company</strong>, and as such offers products to earn their shareholders a profit.
    <br>As we have seen in the previous section, it also offers a way to pay for expense, such as development and administration but earns a profit by burnning (i.e. reducing supply).
    <br>Of course, the company can only be profitable if the income exceeds the expenses.
    <br>Thus, we will now discuss both in detail". [<a class="clsPreview" href="#idBtswpr4">idBtswpr4</a>]

    <br>"DAC is an acronym for a Decentralized Autonomous Corporation (or Decentralized Autonomous Community). This is similar to a co-op, as it is a member-run Corporation, which is self-governing, and can function autonomously. The entire business logic of a DAC is encoded into a smart contract that resides on the blockchain. Also known as a DAO - Decentralized Autonomous Organization."

    <br>As some have already come to recognize the blockchain is much more than just another internet technology it is an institutional technology that has the potential to reshape how we structure organizations. As it matures in the coming decade or two it will add a whole new layer on top of the internet that will enable collaboration like never before. Whereas Web 2.0 gave us the tools for mass distributed collaboration - and in so doing created the internet that we know today operated by large platform companies, half centralized, half distributed - the blockchain will take this model a step further as it will remove the requirement for the centralized institutional layer that currently runs these platforms. In so doing it has the potential to enable the emergence of fully distributed organizations, that will be automated, dynamic and fluid.
    <br>This being said, we still have a long way to go - before these could be truly scaled - both on the technical level, in designing these new forms of self-organizing social organizations, and also on the cultural level of people becoming more comfortable with giving over responsibility, authority and control to automated software systems without centralized human regulation. And there is good reason to be cautious in this process, large automated computer systems can be powerful tools and social fabric can be a delicate thing. Human oversight, intuition, and foresight should continue to play an important role in the management of these platforms until our understanding and technology are mature enough to take over the running of critical management functions.

    <br>In June 2016, hackers exploited a vulnerability in the DAO code to enable them to siphon off one third of The DAO's funds to a subsidiary account.
    <br>On the 20th July 2016, the Ethereum community decided to hard-fork the Ethereum blockchain to restore virtually all funds to the original contract. This was controversial, and led to a fork in Ethereum, where the original unforked blockchain was maintained as Ethereum Classic, thus breaking Ethereum into two separate active cryptocurrencies."

  <p id="idDoznDefdsn">description::
    <br>"In a world that has succeeded in the globalization of financial assets while keeping political rights enclosed to territories, we need to build new models of democratic governance that enable humanity to collaborate and address pressing global issues. Democracy Earth Foundation is building free, open source software for incorruptible blockchain-based decision-making (voting) within institutions of all sizes, from the most local involving two people to the most global involving all of us. Uneven distribution of opportunity around the globe due to the perpetual confrontation between national governments has led to accelerated climate change, rising inequality, terrorism and forced migrations. Democracy Earth Foundation considers that the technology stack that includes Bitcoin as programmable money without Central Banks, and Ethereum enabling smart contracts without the need of Judiciary Courts, requires a new layer that signals incorruptible votes beyond the territorial boundaries of Nation-States. This transnational network will act in accordance with the personal sovereignty of its members and protect their human rights with encryption. In our Initial Rights Offering we offer a token called vote that will grant participation rights to every human with decision-making as its main function. Our proposal introduces cryptographically induced equality: as long as any person is able to validate his or her self-sovereign identity, they will receive a corresponding share of votes that is equal to the share of every active participant in the network. We define a Proof of Identity process that avoids central authority by introducing the concept of attention mining which incentivizes participants to strengthen the trust of votes by performing simple tests aimed at detecting replicants. Finally votes get dripped to valid participants under a Universal Basic Income mechanism with a goal of finding a proper equilibrium in the historical tension between money and politics. We seek nothing less than true democratic governance for the Internet age, one of the foundational building blocks of an achievable global peace and prosperity arising from an arc of technological innovations that will change what it means to be human on Earth."

    <br>DAOs are touted as a new form of legal structure in which ownership, management and control are automated and human involvement is limited or removed, based on a previously agreed upon set of rules.

  <h3 id="idEthddwpr0H3">Abstract
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr0H3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idEthddwpr0P1">This paper describes the first implementation of Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) code to automate organizational governance and decision-making.
    <br>The code can be used by individuals working together collaboratively outside of a traditional corporate form.
    <br>It can also be used by a registered corporate entity to automate formal governance rules contained in corporate bylaws or imposed by law.
    <br>First the DAO concept is described, then minority rights is discussed, and a solution to a “robbing the minority” attack vector is proposed.
    <br>Finally, a practical implementation of a first generation DAO entity is provided using smart contracts written in Solidity on the Ethereum blockchain.

  <section id="idEthddwpr1">
  <h3 id="idEthddwpr1H3">1. Introduction
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr1H3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idEthddwpr1P1">Corporate entities of all kinds are governed by rules that describe permitted and proscribed conduct.
    <br>These rules may exist as private contracts (like bylaws or shareholder agreements) between corporate owners.
    <br>They may also be imposed by law in addition to or in the absence of a written agreement between participants.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr1P1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr1P2">Historically, corporations have only been able to act through people (or through corporate entities that were themselves ultimately controlled by people).
    <br>This presents two simple and fundamental problems.
    <br>Whatever a private contract or public law require: (1) people do not always follow the rules and (2) people do not always agree what the rules actually require.
    <br>Collaboration without a corporate form does not solve these problems, necessarily, and it may introduce others.
    <br>In the absence of a corporate form, an explicit written agreement is substituted for unclear informal “understandings” and the legal protections provided by a corporate form will not be available.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr1P2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr1P3">Rule-breaking within an organization not always obvious, and motives may not matter to stakeholders once their money has been lost.
    <br>While bad behavior may make a corporation or its management civilly or criminally liable, punishment can come as little comfort to an investor who has already lost their money.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr1P3"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr1P4">Crowdfunding (<a class="clsPreview" href="#idMassolution2015">Massolution [2015]</a>) amplifies the problem.
    <br>On the one hand, it has made it easier for small contributors to invest in large projects, and it has also made it possible for entrepreneurs to receive financial support that might not have been easily available in the past.
    <br>On the other hand, small investors remain vulnerable to financial mismanagement or outright fraud, and because they have a small stake in a venture, they may lack power to identify problems, participate in governance decisions, or to easily recover their investment (<a class="clsPreview" href="#idKnibbs2015">Knibbs [2015]</a>, <a class="clsPreview" href="#idBiggs2015">Biggs [2015]</a>).
    <br>At the same time, corporate leadership and management may be accused of malfeasance or mismanagement when they believe that they have acted in good faith, based on their understanding of their obligations and interpretation of applicable rules.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr1P4"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr1P5">This paper presents a potential solution using Ethereum, (<a class="clsPreview" href="#idButerin2013">Buterin [2013]</a>, <a class="clsPreview" href="#idWood2014">Wood [2014]</a>) a blockchain technology which integrates a Turing complete programming language with smart contract processing functionality.
    <br>This paper illustrates a method that for the first time allows the creation of organizations in which (1) participants maintain direct real-time control of contributed funds and (2) governance rules are formalized, automated and enforced using software.
    <br>Specifically, standard smart contract code (<a class="clsPreview" href="#idSzabo1997">Szabo [1997]</a>, <a class="clsPreview" href="#idMiller1997">Miller [1997]</a>) has been written that can be used to form a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) on the Ethereum blockchain.
    <br>This paper explains how a DAO’s code works, focusing on some basic formation and governance features, including structure, creation and voting rights.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr1P5"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr1P6">First a DAO’s Creation Phase and basic functionality are described.
    <br>Then minority owner rights are discussed and a solution to the “Majority Robbing the Minority Attack” problem is proposed: the “DAO split.”
    <br>The smart contract code is then explored in detail, and conclude with an explanation and detailed specification of the “DAO split.”
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr1P6"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr1P7">The code for the smart contracts is located at: <a href="https://github.com/slockit/DAO/">https://github.com/slockit/DAO</a>/
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr1P7"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr1P8">A word of caution, at the outset: the legal status of DAOs remains the subject of active and vigorous debate and discussion.
    <br>Not everyone shares the same definition.
    <br>Some have said that they are autonomous code and can operate independently of legal systems; others have said that they must be owned or operate by humans or human created entities.
    <br>There will be many uses cases, and the DAO code will develop over time.
    <br>Ultimately, how a DAO functions and its legal status will depend on many factors, including how DAO code is used, where it is used, and who uses it.
    <br>This paper does not speculate about the legal status of DAOs worldwide.
    <br>This paper is not intended to offer legal advice or conclusions.
    <br>Anyone who uses DAO code will do so at their own risk.

  <h3 id="idEthddwpr2H3">2. Dao Concept
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr2H3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idEthddwpr2P1">DAO code is written in the “Solidity” programming language.
    <br>A DAO is activated by deployment on the Ethereum blockchain.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr2P1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr2P2">Once deployed, a DAO’s code requires “ether” to engage in transactions on Ethereum.
    <br>Ether is the digital fuel that powers the Ethereum network.
    <br>Without ether, a DAO can not do anything so a DAO’s first order of business is to receive ether.
    <br>After a DAO’s code is deployed, ether may be sent to the DAO’s smart contract address during an initial Creation Phase which is defined in the DAO’s code.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr2P2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr2P3">In exchange for ether, a DAO’s code creates tokens that are assigned to the account of the person who sent the ether.
    <br>The token grants its holder voting and ownership rights.
    <br>The number of tokens created is proportional to the amount of ether transferred.
    <br>Token price varies over time (see <a class="clsPreview" href="#idEthddwpr5">section 5</a>).
    <br>Token ownership is freely transferable on the Ethereum blockchain, when the Creation Phase has ended.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr2P3"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr2P4">A minimum DAO Creation goal and Creation Phase time-period are set as parameters in a DAO’s code at the time of deployment.
    <br>If the minimum DAO Creation goal is not reached at the close of the Creation Phase, all ether is returned.
    <br>After the Creation Phase has ended, the total ether raised is denoted by Ξraised and the total amount of tokens created is denoted by Ttotal.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr2P4"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr2P5">A DAO stores ether and other Ethereum based tokens and transmits them based on the DAO’s code.
    <br>It does not do much else.
    <br>It cannot build a product, write code or develop hardware.
    <br>It requires a “Contractor” to accomplish these and other goals.
    <br>A DAO selects a Contractor by accepting a Contractor’s proposal.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr2P5"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr2P6">Any DAO Token Holder may become a Contractor by submitting proposals to use a DAO’s ether, denoted by Ξtransfer.
    <br>If a proposal is approved, the DAO transmits ether to a smart contract representing the proposed project.
    <br>Such smart contracts can be parameterized and enable a DAO to interact with and influence the project it chose to support.
    <br>An example of such an agreement between a DAO and a project to be funded can be found in <a class="clsPreview" href="#idEthddwprA4">the appendix (A.4)</a>.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr2P6"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr2P7">Members of a DAO cast votes weighted by the amount of tokens they control.
    <br>Tokens are divisible, indistinguishable and can easily be transferred between accounts.
    <br>Within the contracts, the individual actions of members, cannot be directly determined.
    <br>There is a set time frame tp to debate and vote on any given proposal.
    <br>In our example, this time frame is set by the creator of the proposal, and is required to be at least two weeks for a regular proposal.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr2P7"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr2P8">After tp has passed, any token holder can call a function in the DAO contract that will verify that the majority voted in favor of the proposal and that quorum was reached; the function will execute the proposal if this is the case.
    <br>If this is not the case, the proposal will be closed.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr2P8"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpreqn1">The minimum quorum represents the minimum number of tokens required for a vote to be valid, is denoted by qmin, and calculated as follows:
    <br>
    <br><img src="filMcsDtcnet.files/imgEthddwprEqn1.png"> (eqn.1)
    <br>
    <br>Where d is the minQuorumDivisor.
    <br>This parameter’s default value is 5, but it will double in the case the quorum has not been met for over a year.
    <br>ΞDAO is the amount of ether owned by a DAO and RDAO is the amount of reward tokens owned by this DAO, as explained in <a class="clsPreview" href="#idEthddwpr7">section 7</a> (also see rewardToken in <a class="clsPreview" href="#idEthddwprA3">A.3</a>).
    <br>The sum ΞDAO + RDAO is equal to the amount of ether used to Create DAO tokens plus the rewards received or said another way, the total amount of ether a DAO has ever received.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpreqn1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr2P9">This means, initially, a quorum of 20% of all tokens is required for any proposal to pass.
    <br>In the event Ξtransfer equals the amount of ether a DAO has ever received, then a quorum of 53.33% is required.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr2P9"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr2P10">In order to prevent “proposal spam,” a minimal deposit can be required to be paid when creating a proposal, which gets refunded if quorum is achieved.
    <br>If quorum is not achieved, the DAO keeps the proposal deposit.
    <br>The value of the proposal deposit can be changed from the default value by the DAO through another proposal.

  <h3 id="idEthddwpr3H3">3. Notation
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr3H3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idEthddwpr3P1">Throughout this paper, Ξ always represents an amount of ether in its base unit wei.
    <br>This is defined as 1 Wei = 10^-18 Ether (<a class="clsPreview" href="#idWood2014">Wood [2014]</a>).
    <br>Similarly, DAO tokens are denoted with T and always represent the amount of DAO tokens in its base unit, defined as 10^-16 DAO token.

  <h3 id="idEthddwpr4H3">4. Majority robs minority attack
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr4H3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idEthddwpr4P1">Minority owner rights can be a problem in any corporate form.
    <br>Minority rights may be protected or addressed by provisions in corporate governance documents or by statute or judge-made law.
    <br>But many of these solutions fail because minority owners may lack voting rights or the ability to “vote with their feet” and easily retrieve their capital.
    <br>This paper presents a solution to this problem in the DAO’s code.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr4P1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr4P2">A problem every DAO has to mitigate is the ability for the majority to rob the minority by changing governance and ownership rules after DAO formation.
    <br>For example, an attacker with 51% of the tokens, acquired either during the fueling period or created afterwards, could make a proposal to send all the funds to themselves.
    <br>Since they would hold the majority of the tokens, they would always be able to pass their proposals.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr4P2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr4P3">To prevent this, the minority must always have the ability to retrieve their portion of the funds.
    <br>Our solution is to allow a DAO to split into two.
    <br>If an individual, or a group of token holders, disagree with a proposal and want to retrieve their portion of the ether before the proposal gets executed, they can submit and approve a special type of proposal to form a new DAO.
    <br>The token holders that voted for this proposal can then split the DAO moving their portion of the ether to this new DAO, leaving the rest alone only able to spend their own ether.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr4P3"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr4P4">This idea originates from a blog post by Vitalik Buterin (<a class="clsPreview" href="#idButerin2015">Buterin [2015]</a>).
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr4P4"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr4P5">A problem this simple fix doesn’t address is voter apathy:
    <br>some token holders might not be actively involved in their DAO and might not follow proposals closely.
    <br>An attacker could use this to their advantage.
    <br>Even though the minority has the chance to retrieve their funds and split the DAO, some could be unaware of the situation and fail to act.
    <br>For a DAO to be considered safe, it is required that inactive token holders must also be protected from losing their ether.
    <br>Our proposed solution is implemented by limiting each individual DAO to a single Curator.
    <br>This Curator controls the list of addresses that can receive ether from the DAO, across all proposals.
    <br>This gives the Curator of a DAO considerable power.
    <br>To prevent the abuse of this power, it is possible for a DAO to vote for a new Curator, which may result in a split of the DAO as described above.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr4P5"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr4P6">Any token holder can make a proposal to vote for a new Curator.
    <br>In effect, even a single token holder is able to both retrieve their remaining portion of ether and maintain their right to any future rewards associated to their previous contribution, as these will be sent to the new DAO automatically.
    <br>Rewards are defined as any ether received by a DAO generated from products the DAO funded so far and are explained in further detail in <a class="clsPreview" href="#idEthddwpr7">section 7</a>.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr4P6"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr4P7">The process of choosing a new Curator is as follows:
    <br>Any token holder can submit a proposal for a new Curator.
    <br>In this case, no proposal deposit is required, because an attacker could vote for an extremely high deposit, preventing any splits.
    <br>The debating period for this proposal is 7 days.
    <br>This is 7 days less than the minimum required for regular proposals, allowing anyone to retrieve their funds before a potentially malicious proposal goes through.
    <br>There is no quorum requirement, so that every token holder has the ability to split into their own DAO.
    <br>The debating period is used to discuss (on or off-chain) the new Curator and conduct a first vote that’s non-binding.
    <br>After this first vote, token holders can confirm its results or not.
    <br>In the case a majority opts to keep the original Curator, the minority can either keep the original Curator in order to avoid a split, or inversely they can confirm their vote for a new Curator and move their portion of the ether to a new DAO.

  <h3 id="idEthddwpr5H3">5. Token Price
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr5H3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idEthddwpreqn2-3">DAO Token Creation rate decreases over time.
    <br>This reflects an assumption that early acts of DAO Creation have greater risk, as they may have less information about the potential success of the DAO and do not know whether what contribution will lead to full fueling of the DAO.
    <br>The DAO described in this paper has the following Creation schedule:
    <br>
    <br><img src="filMcsDtcnet.files/imgEthddwprEqn2-3.png"> (eqn.2-3)
    <br>
    <br>Here t is the unix time in seconds, tc is the closing time of the fueling period (see <a class="clsPreview" href="#idEthddwprA2">A.2</a> closingTime), w is a week in seconds and d a day in seconds.
    <br>Hence the number of tokens (in its base unit) each person Creates is calculated as: P(t)· Ξc.
    <br>Here Ξc stands for the amount of ether sent to fuel a DAO, denoted in wei.
    <br>This results in a constant Creation rate in the beginning, until 2 weeks before the end of the DAO Creation Phase.
    <br>At this time the amount of ether required to Create DAO tokens increases daily by 0.05 Ξc per base unit of DAO token.
    <br>Until 4 days before the closing time when there will be a constant Creation rate of 1.5 Ξc per base unit of DAO token.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpreqn2-3"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr5P1">Creation rate decreases during the Creation Phase could lead to a situation where a single contributor, having Created DAO tokens at the initial Creation rate, could split the DAO immediately after the Creation Phase ends, thereby receiving more ether than they put in due to other contributors having fueled a DAO at a higher Creation rate (<a href="#idGreen2016">Green [2016]</a>).
    <br>In order to avoid that possibility, all ether that is used to fuel a DAO above the initial Creation rate, will be sent to an extra account.
    <br>Denoted as extraBalance in <a class="clsPreview" href="#idEthddwprA2">A.2</a>.
    <br>This ether can be sent back to the DAO through a proposal after the DAO has spent at least this amount of ether.
    <br>This rule is implemented in the internal function isRecipientAllowed in <a class="clsPreview" href="#idEthddwpr63">section 6.3</a>.

  <h3 id="idEthddwpr6H3">6. Contracts
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr6H3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idEthddwpr6P1">This section will detail the smart contracts implementing the aforementioned concept.
    <br>The contracts are written in the programming language Solidity (<a class="clsPreview" href="#idReitwWood2015">Reitwiessner and Wood [2015]</a>).
    <br>Each contract has member variables and functions which can be externally called by sending a transaction to the Ethereum network with the DAO contract address as the recipient and the method ID (optional with parameters) as data.
    <br>This section will discuss the meaning of the variables and the functions in detail.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr6P1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr6P2">The main contract is called ’DAO’.
    <br>It defines the inner workings of the DAO and it derives the member variables and functions from ’Token’ and ’TokenCreation’.
    <br>Token defines the inner workings of the DAO Token and TokenCreation defines how the DAO token is created by fueling the DAO with ether.
    <br>In addition to these three contracts, there is the ’ManagedAccount’ contract, which acts as a helper contract to store the rewards which are to be distributed to the token holders and the extraBalance (see <a class="clsPreview" href="#idEthddwpr5">section 5</a>).
    <br>The contract ’SampleOffer’ (<a class="clsPreview" href="#idEthddwprA4">A.4</a>) is an example of what a proposal from a contractor to the DAO could look like.

  <p id="idEthddwpr61P2">Above is the interface of the Token contract.
    <br>The interfaces of these contracts are used in the text of this document to give a simple overview of the functions and variables used in the contract, the full implementation can be found in <a class="clsPreview" href="#idEthddwprA1">the appendix (A.1)</a>.
    <br>This contract represents the standard token as described here: <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Standardized_Contract_APIs">https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Standardized_Contract_APIs</a>, and the contract <a href="https://github.com/ConsenSys/Tokens/blob/master/Token_Contracts/contracts/Standard_Token.sol">https://github.com/ConsenSys/Tokens/blob/master/Token_Contracts/contracts/Standard_Token.sol</a> was used as a starting point for the contracts creation.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr61P2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr61P3">The map balances stores the number of DAO tokens which are controlled by an address.
    <br>All contracts which derive from TokenInterface can directly modify this map, but only 4 functions do so: createTokenProxy, transfer, transferFrom and splitDAO.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr61P3"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr61P4">The map allowed is used to track the previously specified addresses that are allowed to send tokens on someone else’s behalf.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr61P4"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr61P5">The integer totalSupply is the total number of DAO tokens in existence.
    <br>The public keyword creates a function with the same name as the variable which returns its value so that it is publically available.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr61P5"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr61P6">The function balanceOf returns the balance of the specified address.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr61P6"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr61P7">The function transfer is used to send token from the sender of the message to another address.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr61P7"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr61P8">The function transferFrom is used to transfer tokens on behalf of someone else who has approved the transfer in advance using the approve function.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr61P8"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr61P9">The function approve can be used by the DAO token owner to specify a certain spender to transfer a specified value from their account using the transferFrom function.
    <br>To check whether a certain address is allowed to spend DAO tokens on behalf of someone else, the allowance function can be used, which returns the number of tokens which can be spent by the spender.
    <br>This is similar to writing a check.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr61P9"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr61P10">The event Transfer is used to inform lightweight clients about changes in balances.

  <p id="idEthddwpr62P10">createTokenProxy.
    <br>This function creates one unit of the DAO tokens minimum denomination for every wei sent.
    <br>The price is calculated as
    <br>Ξc · 20/divisor
    <br>Here Ξc is the amount of wei given in order to create tokens, and divisor is calculated depending on the time: 20/P(t) , as described in <a class="clsPreview" href="#idEthddwpr5">section 5</a>.
    <br>The parameter tokenHolder defines the receiver of the newly minted tokens.

    <br>The main feature added is the splitting mechanism and all that comes with it.
    <br>This section will define the member variables and functions from the above smart contract one at a time.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P3">The array proposals holds all the proposals ever made.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P3"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P4">The integer minQuorumDivisor is used to calculate the quorum needed for a proposal to pass.
    <br>It is set to 5, but will double in the case a quorum has not been reached for over a year.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P4"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P5">The integer lastTimeMinQuorumMet keeps track of the last time the quorum was reached.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P5"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P6">The address curator is set at the creation of the DAO and defines the Curator.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P6"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P7">The list allowedRecipients is commonly referred to as the whitelist.
    <br>The DAO can only send transactions to itself, the curator, extraBalance and addresses in the whitelist.
    <br>Only the curator can add/remove addresses to/from the whitelist.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P7"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P8">The map rewardToken tracks the addresses that are owed rewards generated by the products of the DAO.
    <br>Those addresses can only be DAOs.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P8"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P9">The integer totalRewardToken tracks the amount of reward tokens in existence.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P9"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P10">The variable rewardAccount is of the type ManagedAccount , which will be discussed in A.5.
    <br>It is used to manage the rewards which are to be distributed to the DAO Token Holders.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P10"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P11">Similar, DAOrewardAccount is also of the type ManagedAccount.
    <br>This account is used to receive all rewards from projects funded by the DAO.
    <br>It will then redistribute them amongst all splitted DAOs as well as itself using the function retrieveDAOReward.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P11"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P12">The map paidOut is used to keep track how much wei a single token holder has already retrieved from rewardAccount.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P12"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P13">Similar, the map DAOpaidOut is used to keep track how much a single DAO has already received from DAOrewardAccount.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P13"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P14">The map blocked stores the addresses of the DAO Tokens that have voted and therefore are not allowed to be transferred until the vote has concluded.
    <br>The address points to the proposal ID.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P14"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P15">The integer proposalDeposit specifies the minimum deposit to be paid in wei for any proposal that does not include a change of the Curator.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P15"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P16">The integer sumOfProposalDeposits is the sum of all proposal deposits of open proposals.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P16"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P17">The contract daoCreator is used to create a new DAO with the same code as this DAO, used in the case of a split.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P17"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P18">A single proposal has the parameters:
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P18"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P19">recipient: The address where the amount of wei will go to if the proposal is accepted.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P19"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P20">amount: The amount of wei to transfer to recipient if the proposal is accepted.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P20"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P21">description: A plain text description of the proposal.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P21"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P22">votingDeadline: A unix timestamp, denoting the end of the voting period.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P22"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P23">open: A boolean which is false if the votes have already been counted, true otherwise.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P23"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P24">proposalPassed: A boolean which is true if a quorum has been achieved with the majority approving the proposal.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P24"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P25">proposalHash: A hash to check validity of a proposal.
    <br>Equal to sha3(_recipient, _amount, _transactionData).
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P25"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P26">proposalDeposit: The deposit (in wei) the creator of a proposal has send to submit a proposal.
    <br>It is taken from the msg.value of a newProposal call; its purpose is to prevent spam.
    <br>Its minimal value is set when the contract is deployed as constructor parameter.
    <br>But the creator of the proposal can send any amount above this for the deposit.
    <br>The proposals will be sorted by the proposal deposit in the GUI, so in the case that a proposal is considered important, the creator of the proposal can deposit extra ether to advertise their proposal.
    <br>The creator of the proposal will be refunded the entire deposit if quorum is reached, if it is not reached the deposit remains with the DAO.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P26"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P27">newCurator: A boolean which is true if this proposal assigns a new Curator.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P27"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P28">splitData: The data used to split the DAO.
    <br>This data is gathered from proposals when they require a new Curator.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P28"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P29">yea: Number of tokens in favor of the proposal.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P31"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P32">votedNo: Simple mapping to check if a token holder has voted against it.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P32"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P33">creator: The address of the token holder that created the proposal.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P33"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P34">The split data structure is used to split the DAO.
    <br>It contains:
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P34"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P35">splitBalance: The balance of the current DAO minus the proposal deposit at the time of split.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P35"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P36">totalSupply: The total amount of DAO tokens in existence at the time of the split.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P38"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P39">Those are all the member variables which are stored in this smart contract on the blockchain.
    <br>This information can at any time be read from the blockchain using an Ethereum client.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P39"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P40">This section will discuss the functions of the DAO contract in detail.
    <br>Many of the member variables that are used in this contract are defined in one of the other three contracts.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P40"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P41">There is a special function which is called the constructor.
    <br>It has the same name as the contract “DAO.”
    <br>This function is only executed once, when the DAO is created.
    <br>In the DAO constructor, the following variables are set:
    <br>• curator
    <br>• daoCreator
    <br>• proposalDeposit
    <br>• rewardAccount
    <br>• DAOrewardAccount
    <br>• minTokensToCreate
    <br>• closingTime
    <br>• privateCreation
    <br>• lastTimeMinQuorumMet
    <br>• minQuorumDivisor
    <br>• allowedRecipients
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P41"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P42">In order to interact with the smart contract the following functions are used:
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P42"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P43">fallback function. The fallback function is a function without a specific name.
    <br>It is called when the contract receives a transaction without data (a pure value transfer).
    <br>There are no direct arguments for this function.
    <br>The fallback function will call createTokenProxy passing the address of the sender as an argument during the Creation Phase.
    <br>This will trigger the immediate creation of tokens.
    <br>In order to protect users, this function will send the ether received after the end of the Creation Phase back to the sender for a time period of 40 days.
    <br>After which this function is repurposed to receive ether as simple deposit to the DAO using the function receiveEther.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P43"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P44">receiveEther. A simple function used to receive ether.
    <br>It does nothing but return true when the DAO receives ether.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P44"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P45">newProposal. This function is used to create a new proposal.
    <br>The arguments of the function are:
    <br>recipient: The address of the recipient of the ether in the proposal (has to be the DAO address itself, the current Curator or an address on the whitelist allowedRecipients).
    <br>amount: The amount of wei to be sent in the proposed transaction.
    <br>description: A string describing the proposal.
    <br>transactionData: The data of the proposed transaction.
    <br>debatingPeriod: The amount of time to debate the proposal, at least 2 weeks for a normal proposal
    <br>and at least 1 week for a new Curator proposal.
    <br>newCurator: A boolean defining whether this proposal is for a new Curator or not.
    <br>After checking the sanity of the proposal (see code), this function creates a proposal which is open for voting for a certain amount of time.
    <br>The function will return a proposal ID which is used to vote.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P45"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P46">checkProposalCode. This function is used to check that a certain proposal ID matches a certain transaction.
    <br>The arguments of the function are:
    <br>proposalID: The proposal ID.
    <br>recipient: The address of the recipient of the proposed transaction.
    <br>amount: The amount of wei to be sent with the proposed transaction.
    <br>transactionData: The data of the proposed transaction.
    <br>If the recipient, the amount and the transactionData match the proposal ID, the function will return true, otherwise it will return false.
    <br>This will be used to verify that the proposal ID matches what the DAO token holder thinks they are voting on.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P46"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P47">vote. This function is used to vote on a proposal.
    <br>The arguments of the function are:
    <br>proposalID: The proposal ID.
    <br>supportsProposal: A boolean Yes/No does the DAO token holder support the proposal
    <br>The function simply checks whether the sender has yet to vote and whether the proposal is still open for voting.
    <br>If both requirements are met, it records the vote in the storage of the contract.
    <br>The tokens used to vote will be blocked, meaning they can not be transferred until the proposal is closed.
    <br>This is to avoid voting several times with different sender addresses.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P47"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P48">executeProposal. This function can be called by anyone.
    <br>It counts the votes, in order to check whether the quorum is met, and executes the proposal if it passed, unless it is a proposal for a new Curator, than it does nothing.
    <br>The arguments of the function are:
    <br>proposalID: The proposal ID.
    <br>transactionData: The data of the proposed transaction
    <br>The function checks whether the voting deadline has passed and that the transactionData matches the proposal ID.
    <br>Then it checks whether the quorum has been met (see Eq. 1) and if the proposal had a majority of support.
    <br>If this is the case, it executes the proposal and refunds the proposal deposit.
    <br>If the quorum has been achieved, but the proposal was declined by the majority of the voters, the proposal deposit is refunded and the proposal closes.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P48"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P49">splitDAO. After a new Curator has been proposed, and the debating period in which the token holders could vote for or against the proposal has passed, this function is called by each of the DAO token holders that want to leave the current DAO and move to a new DAO with the proposed new Curator.
    <br>This function creates a new DAO and moves a portion of the ether, as well as a portion of the reward tokens to the new DAO.
    <br>The arguments are:
    <br>proposalID: The proposal ID.
    <br>newCurator: The address of the new Curator of the new DAO.
    <br>After a sanity check (see code), this function will create the new DAO if it hasnt already been created using the contract daoCreator, updates the split data stored in the proposal and stores the address of the new DAO in the split data.
    <br>This function moves the portion of ether that belongs to the caller of this function in the original DAO to the new DAO.
    <br>This ether amount is denoted by Ξsender, stated in wei and is calculated as follows:
    <br>
    <br><img src="filMcsDtcnet.files/imgEthddwprEqn4.png"> (eqn.4)
    <br>
    <br>Here Tsender is the amount of tokens of the caller of the function and ΞDAO is the balance of the DAO at the time of the split.
    <br>This will be used to effectively create tokens in the newly created DAO and fuel the new DAO just as the original DAO was fueled.
    <br>In addition to the ether which is moved to the new DAO, the reward tokens Rsender are also transferred.
    <br>They are calculated as follows:
    <br>
    <br><img src="filMcsDtcnet.files/imgEthddwprEqn5.png"> (eqn.5)
    <br>
    <br>Where RDAO is the amount of reward tokens owned by the original DAO at the time of the split.
    <br>These tokens allow the new DAO to retrieve their portion of the reward using the retrieveDAOReward function of the original DAO.
    <br>At the end of this process all original DAO tokens of the sender account are destroyed.
    <br>It is important to notice that in all integer division descirbed above, there may be remainders which stay with the DAO.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P49"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P50">newContract. This function can only be called by the DAO itself (through a proposal and a vote) and is used to move all remaining ether, as well as all rewardTokens to a new address.
    <br>This is used to update the contract.
    <br>The new address needs to be approved by the Curator.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P50"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P51">transfer and transferFrom. These functions overload the functions defined in the Token contract.
    <br>They do call transfer / transferFrom function in the Token contract, but they additionally transfer information about the already paid out rewards attached to the tokens being transferred using the transferPaidOut function.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P51"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P52">transferPaidOut. This function is called when making any transfer of DAO tokens using transfer or transferFrom and it updates the array paidOut to track the amount of rewards which has been paid out already, P, and is calculated as follows:
    <br>
    <br><img src="filMcsDtcnet.files/imgEthddwprEqn6.png"> (eqn.6)
    <br>
    <br>Here Pfrom is the total amount of ether which has been paid out to the from address (the sender), Tamount is the amount of tokens to be transferred and Tfrom is the amount of tokens owned by the from address.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P52"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P53">transferWithoutReward and transferFromWithoutReward.
    <br>The same as transfer and transferFrom, but it calls getMyReward prior to that.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P53"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P54">getMyReward. Calls withdrawRewardFor with the sender as the parameter.
    <br>This is used to withdraw the portion of the rewards which belong to the sender from the rewardAccount.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P54"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P55">withdrawRewardFor. This function is used to retrieve the portion of the rewards in the rewardAccount which belong to the address given as a parameter.
    <br>The amount of ether Ξreward which is then sent to the DAO token holder that
    <br>calls this function is:
    <br>
    <br><img src="filMcsDtcnet.files/imgEthddwprEqn7.png"> (eqn.7)
    <br>
    <br>Here ΞrewardAccount is the total rewards ever received by the rewardAccount and ΞpaidOut[sender] is the total amount of wei which has already been paid out to the DAO token holder address, which is given as a parameter.
    <br>The reward tokens are further elaborated in section 8.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P55"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P56">retrieveDAOReward. This function, when called by a DAO, sends the rewards which belong to this DAO from DAOrewardAccount to either the DAO itself, or to the rewardAccount of the respective DAO in order to be distributed among its token holders, depending on the parameter _toMembers.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P56"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P57">changeAllowedRecipients. This function can add/remove an address to/from the whitelist, allowedRecipients.
    <br>It can only be executed by the Curator.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P57"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P58">halveMinQuorum. When called, halves the minimum quorum in the case it has not been met for over 52 weeks, by doubling minQuorumDivisor.
    <br>Also the curator can call this function without the 52 weeks limit, but not more than once every other week.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P58"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P59">numberOfProposals. Returns the total number of proposals ever created.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P59"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P60">getNewDAOAdress. This is just a helper function to read the address of a newly created ‘split DAO‘.
    <br>It gets the proposal ID which was used for the split as input parameter and returns the address of the new DAO.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P60"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P61">isBlocked. This function returns true when the address given as parameter is currently blocked to transfer tokens due to an ongoing vote it has participated in, otherwise it returns false.
    <br>It also unblocks the tokens in the case the voting deadline of the proposal is over.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P61"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P62">unblockMe. Calling isBlocked with the address of the sender.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr63P62"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr63P63">changeProposalDeposit. This function changes the parameter proposalDeposit. It can only be called by the DAO through a transaction which was proposed and voted for by a majority of the token holders.

  <h3 id="idEthddwpr7H3">7. Reward Tokens
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr7H3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idEthddwpr7P1">This section gives a description of how reward tokens are implemented in this contract.
    <br>Much of the information has already been explained, but it is restated here for clarity.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr7P1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr7P2">Reward tokens are used to divide the ether sent to DAOrewardAccount amongst the various DAOs that own reward tokens.
    <br>Reward tokens are only transferred in the event of a DAO split or an update of the contract, they can never be owned by anything other than the original DAO or a fork of the original DAO that generated the reward tokens.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr7P2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr7P3">Reward tokens are generated when the DAO makes any transaction spending ether.
    <br>When the DAOs products send ether back to the DAO, the ether is held within DAOrewardAccount.
    <br>The DAO can use these rewards to fund new proposals or to fairly distribute the rewards to the reward token holders (using a proposal which gets voted on by the DAO token holders).
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr7P3"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr7P4">Then the token holders of the DAOs will be able to claim the ether they have earned for their contribution to the original DAO that issued the reward token.
    <br>To do this the DAO retrieve its rewards by callling the retrieveDAOReward function, with the paramter _toMembers set to true, which send the rewards to the rewardAccount (a ManagedAccount contract) and keeps track of the payouts in DAOpaidOut.
    <br>Then and only then will the token holders of the DAOs be able to call the getMyReward function and receive their ether.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr7P4"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr7P5">These payouts are tracked by the map paidOut which keeps track of which token holders have claimed their fair portion of the rewards.
    <br>This process guarantees that any DAO token holder whose ether was spent building a product will receive the rewards promised to them from that product even if they decide to split from the DAO.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr7P5"></a></p>

  <section id="idEthddwpr8">
  <h3 id="idEthddwpr8H3">8. Split
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr8H3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idEthddwpr8P1">This section formally describes a few important parameters and their behavior during a split.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr8P1"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr8P2">The total amount of DAO tokens totalSupply is defined as follows:
    <br>
    <br><img src="filMcsDtcnet.files/imgEthddwprEqn8.png"> (eqn.8)
    <br>
    <br>Where Ti is the amount of DAO tokens owned by an address i (balances[i]).
    <br>Note that 2^256 is the total number of possible addresses in Ethereum.
    <br>Similarly, the amount of reward tokens Rtotal is defined as follows:
    <br>
    <br><img src="filMcsDtcnet.files/imgEthddwprEqn9.png"> (eqn.9)
    <br>
    <br>For every passed proposal that sends ether out of the DAO, an amount of reward tokens equal to the amount being spent (in wei) is created.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr8P2"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr8P3">Lets assume that during the split, a fraction of DAO tokens, X, changes the Curator and leaves the DAO.
    <br>The new DAO created receives X · ΞDAO pre, a portion of the remaining ether from the original DAO.
    <br>
    <br><img src="filMcsDtcnet.files/imgEthddwprEqn10.png"> (eqn.10)
    <br>
    <br>Here ΞDAO pre is the ether balance of the original DAO before the split and ΞDAO post is the ether balance of the original DAO after the split.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr8P3"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr8P4">A portion of the reward tokens is transferred to the new DAO in a very similar manner:
    <br>
    <br><img src="filMcsDtcnet.files/imgEthddwprEqn11.png"> (eqn.11)
    <br>
    <br>Here RDAO is the amount of reward tokens owned by the DAO (prior to the first split 100% of all rewards tokens ever created are owned by the DAO).
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr8P4"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr8P5"><img src="filMcsDtcnet.files/imgEthddwprEqn12.png"> (eqn.12)
    <br>
    <br>The number of reward tokens owned by the new DAO are denoted by RnewDAO.
    <br>The total amount of reward tokens Rtotal stays constant during the split, no reward tokens are ever destroyed.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr8P5"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr8P6">The original DAO tokens of the accounts that confirmed the new Curator are destroyed. Hence:
    <br>
    <br><img src="filMcsDtcnet.files/imgEthddwprEqn13.png"> (eqn.13)
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr8P6"></a></p>
  <p id="idEthddwpr8P7">This process allows DAO token holders to retrieve their ether from the DAO at any time without losing out on any of the future rewards.
    <br>They are entitled to receive even if they choose to leave the DAO.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr8P7"></a></p>
  </section>

  <section id="idEthddwpr9">
  <h3 id="idEthddwpr9H3">9. Updates
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idEthddwpr9H3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idEthddwpr9P1">Although the code of the contract specified at a certain address in the Ethereum blockchain can not be changed, there might still be a need for a single member or the DAO as a whole to change the contracts.
    <br>Every single member can always split the DAO as described above and move their funds to a new DAO.
    <br>From there they can move their funds to another new DAO with a new smart contract.
    <br>But in order to use a new code for the complete DAO one can simply create a new DAO contract with all the needed features and deploy it on the blockchain, and make a proposal to call the newContract function with the address of the new contract as parameter.
    <br>If accepted, the complete DAO moves to the new contract, meaning, all ether and reward tokens are transferred to the new contract.
    <br>In order to use the same underlying DAO tokens there, one can use the approve function and give the new DAO the right to move the tokens.
    <br>In the new contract this right should only be usable in restricted functions which are only callable by the owner of the tokens.
    <br>Another option is to create new tokens in the new contract based on the token distribution in the old contract.
    <br>This can also be achieved by a proof that the old tokens are destroyed (sending to the 0 address).
    <br>This process allows for the DAO to maintain static immutable code on the Ethereum blockchain, while still being able to be updated if the need arises.

    <br>The DAO was[citation needed] a digital decentralized autonomous organization and a form of investor-directed venture capital fund.[5]
    <br>The DAO had an objective to provide a new decentralized business model for organizing both commercial and non-profit enterprises.[6][7] It was instantiated on the Ethereum blockchain, and had no conventional management structure or board of directors.[6] The code of the DAO is open-source.[8]
    <br>The DAO was stateless, and not tied to any particular nation state. As a result, many questions of how government regulators would deal with a stateless fund were yet to be dealt with.[9]
    <br>The DAO was crowdfunded via a token sale in May 2016. It set the record for the largest crowdfunding campaign in history.[5]
    <br>In June 2016, hackers exploited a vulnerability in the DAO code to enable them to siphon off one third of The DAO's funds to a subsidiary account. On the 20th July 2016, the Ethereum community decided to hard-fork the Ethereum blockchain to restore virtually all funds to the original contract.[10] This was controversial, and led to a fork in Ethereum, where the original unforked blockchain was maintained as Ethereum Classic, thus breaking Ethereum into two separate active cryptocurrencies.[11][12]

  <p id="idEthdaoThdEvgP1">{2016-07-20}:
    <br>=== the-hard-fork:
    <br>The specs were implemented by the client’s developers (including Geth, Parity, EthereumJ, Đ-Eth, etc) and the choice whether to fork or not was left to the community by using a switch when starting their client. At block 1920000 (on July 20th), the hard fork became active as a majority of miners and nodes moved to the new version of the chain. The hard fork worked smoothly.
    <br>Original DAO token holders started to withdraw their ETH, while the signatories of the curator multisig started to work on the edge cases (note: this is still a work in progress)
    <br>Surprisingly, the old chain did receive more support than expected. Exchanges listed the token of the old chain (under the name “Ether classic”), and blockchain explorers were created. Users found themselves confronted with the choice of two chains, which challenged the former Robin Hood Group to start the process of also returning the ETC, an ongoing process.

    <br>===  The DAO ICO
    <br>April 30, 2016 - May 28, 2016
    <br>Crowdsale Details
    <br>The DAO, a distributed autonomous organization and future client of Slock.it, is holding an ICO. It is not quite a crowdsale: the DAO is selling ownership of itself and raising ETH in the process. The DAO’s first act will be to hire Slock.it to do their work.
    <br>
    <br>How are funds collected?&nbsp; &nbsp; To obtain DAO tokens, follow the wizard here or send ETH from your Ethereum Wallet (NOT an exchange) to The DAO’s address, given on on the same page.
    <br>Coin Distribution&nbsp; &nbsp; All tokens will be distributed to those who contribute ETH. None are set aside for developers.
    <br>Escrow Used&nbsp; &nbsp; Unknown
    <br>Rate&nbsp; &nbsp; 100 DAO Tokens per ETH for the first 14 days (roughly $.08/token). Then a linear increase for the next 10 days. For last 14 days, 100 DAO Tokens per 1.5 ETH (roughly $.12/token)
    <br>Project Valuation&nbsp; &nbsp; Currently unknown, the valuation will be based on the amount of ETH raised.
    <br>Currencies used&nbsp; &nbsp; ETH
    <br>
    <br>How do the coins or tokens work?
    <br>How are they used?&nbsp; &nbsp; The tokens represent ownership over the DAO, which includes being able to nominate and vote on DAO activities, nominate and vote on DAO curators. At any point, token holders can burn their tokens and retrieve their unspent ETH. Read more about token holder abilities here.
    <br>What is the market for these coins?&nbsp; &nbsp; Any profits the DAO makes on its investments will be given back to token holders as dividends.
    <br>How are they produced?&nbsp; &nbsp; The only way future DAO tokens are created is through vote of the token holders.

    <br>"Holographic Consensus
    <br>This protocol helps DAOs prioritize their most value-aligned proposals, even with millions of members.
    <br>People stake GEN on which proposals the DAO will pass. (GEN is a cryptocurrency for collective attention in DAOs)
    <br>After a few stakes, a proposal highly predicted to pass will move to the top of the list, where voters will vote on whether to pass it.
    <br>When a vote finishes, people who predicted correctly make a profit on their stake.
    <br>This incentivizes people to correctly predict what DAOs care about, and lets DAOs make good decisions without requiring everyone to vote on everything."

    <br>"GEN Prediction is a prediction system embedded in DAOstack’s unique DAO governance protocol, which can be accessed through <a class="clsPreview" href="#idDaostkAlcm">the Alchemy interface</a>. It plays a vital role in solving a basic problem of governance: how to efficiently make decisions that accurately represent the views of large groups of people."
    <br>[https://medium.com/daostack/joining-the-gen-predictors-network-f7be2d93754d]
    <br>===
    <br>"In such a DAO, both members and non-members can stake GEN on a proposal, betting that the DAO will either pass or fail it. They have strong motive to do this since correct predictions will earn them a reward. Essentially, both DAO members and outsiders have the opportunity to offer a DAO their expert attention in exchange for a GEN reward, helping the DAO focus on the highest-leverage proposals and make smarter collective decisions. Put another way, any individual who confidently believes a particular proposal will pass can boost it by purchasing a large prediction stake, directly influencing the DAO’s collective attention. This set of incentives is a core part of what we call the “holographic consensus” approach.
    <br>... All organizations built on DAOstack are free to install the GEN prediction system in their own governance schemes, and there are some good reasons to include it: 1) GEN prediction puts an existing network of knowledgeable, active predictors to work for you, 2) the module to activate it is pre-built, and 3) it gives the entire GEN ecosystem skin in the game of your DAO’s success."

    <br>"Why should I ask for reputation when submitting a proposal?
    <br>You are not required to ask for reputation when submitting a proposal. However, if you would like to be a decision-maker within the DAO, you should request some. Proposals are ultimately passed or failed based off of the voting of reputation holders; without it, you have no ability to help steer the DAO. Generally, having those who submit and execute proposals be the DAO’s decision-makers helps promote a meritocratic governance system."
    <br>"How much reputation should I ask for when submitting a proposal?
    <br>It’s ultimately up to you, but the norm within the Genesis DAO thus far is a range from 0 to 200 reputation points, varying based on the scope of the project. If you have a good rationale why you should be rewarded more, you are welcome to articulate that in your proposal."

The best strategy to get a proposal boosted is to write a compelling proposal that is aligned with the DAO’s purpose.

At the most basic level, social reputation plays a significant role, particularly while the DAO remains very small. At a more procedural level, Genesis Alpha now also has an Accountability Task Force, who is tasked with promoting follow-through and directly penalizing non-delivery, such as by raising proposals to subtract reputation or stop future payments. The DAO is also considering adding escrow functionality that will also help ensure accountability."

The first was that Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are the most important use case of the blockchain after currency, and the second was that it is impossible to predict what these DAOs will look like, and that there will be a fast evolution of them."

    <br>"Launched June 2018, the Genesis Alpha was the first DAO powered by DAOstack. Genesis Beta is the second step of a three step plan to eventually transition Genesis to being the “Coordinator DAO” of the DAOstack ecosystem. According to the DAOstack team’s recent statement, Genesis would have additional responsibilities as coordinator, such as management of 40m unminted GEN. In this sense, it could be a decentralized institution that distributes ecosystemic grants loosely analogous to the Ethereum Foundation."

    <br>"DACs are the future, lets help build them!
    <br>I am part of the launch team of eosDAC and have been serving as an interim custodian since launch.
    <br>Block Production
    <br>Since before the launch of the chain I have been involved in EOS testnets going right back to the days of the Superhero Network. Was heavily involved in the launch of the mainnet and I now have over 1 years experience running EOSIO software. Since launch I have been leading the block production team at eosDAC and we have consistently been within the top 21.
    <br>We currently have over 17 machines running our infrastructure and are running on 5 networks (including 2 live blockchains). I have been working closely with members of Block One to find and fix bugs in the EOSIO software and I earned the bug bounty for finding a bug in EOSIO which could crash any node.
    <br>Software Architect
    <br>I have been the Senior Developer working on the eosDAC suite of contracts, including the voting, token and supporting contracts. We have built the major contracts which support election, as well as designing the permissions layout and a nicely designed front-end to make it possible for non-technical people to be involved in running a DAC.
    <br>Community support
    <br>As part of our work in enabling DACs - I have been involved in supporting other DAPPs within the EOS ecosystem as a technical advisor. I was a mentor at the London EOS Hackathon in 2018, and regularly support and engage with the EOS community. I will always fight for the interests of the token holders when representing eosDAC and hope that we can be a strong voice in the future of the chain.
    <br>The Future
    <br>We have achieved a lot so far at eosDAC and it has been much harder than any of us imagined, but there is still a long way to go. I hope that we can continue the work done so far and prove that the concept of a DAC can work, even across international and cultural boundaries."

    <br>"My Role With eosDAC
    <br>I was first contacted about joining eosDAC in March of 2018. Since then, I've been actively involved in all aspects of the DAC from block production, to technical management, to development and operational coordination. As a custodian, I'll approve worker proposals that directly add value to the DAC and use our funds wisely to build the foundations we need to be sustainable and enable DACs for many years to come.
    <br>Philosophy
    <br>I think on-chain governance with decentralized autonomous communities is one of the best paths forward for finding non-violent consensus and improving human well-being. I believe all human interactions should be voluntary and monopolies on violence and currency creation within geographic regions will become archaic relics of our past. Our circle of empathy is expanding towards cooperation and abundance. Technologies like EOS empower us all to function as efficient peer networks instead of dominating hierarchies. Non-violent communication, education, and blockchain consensus can help the right BPs secure and protect this collaborative commons. Entrepreneurship, specialization, economic freedom, and mutually beneficial exchange of value will increase prosperity for us all if EOS is run by the right block producers.
    <br>Background
    <br>I built my first websites in 1996, got a degree in computer science at UPENN in 2001, and eventually co-founded FoxyCart.com which I sold to my business partner in 2018 after ten successful years to focus full-time on projects in the cryptocurrency space. My first bitcoin purchase was in January of 2013 where I paid $50 to get 2.5 BTC. I have been a Steem Witness (block producer) since May of 2017 and joined the launch team of eosDAC in April of 2018. I like to be involved in and learn from many different cryptocurrency projects like BitShares and SmartCash. Since 2013, I have been educating people about cryptocurrency and explaining the complexities of blockchains in simple terms with projects like http://understandingblockchainfreedom.com/"

    <br>"I am a member of the core senior team of eosDAC, a block producer on the EOS blockchain and decentralised autonomous community.
    <br>I am involved at the executive level with our open-source finance and strategy workstreams with respect to such matters as:
    <br>- our governance and legal relationships
    <br>- our team and team organisation
    <br>- how we encode our Constitution (https://github.com/eosdac/constitution/blob/master/constitution.md) into smart contracts, from a non-technical perspective
    <br>- how we, as a decentralised autonomous community - an entity not yet recognised in law - interact with the off-chain world, including how we contract for and pay for services
    <br>- how we identify and mitigate financial risk
    <br>- how we build the EOS ecosystem, including through supporting other DACs and blockchain projects, and how we evaluate those projects
    <br>- how we create open-source financial, workflow and HR systems within the DAC, so as to establish maximal alignment of interests and minimal information asymmetry (https://steemit.com/eosdac/@eosdac/eosdac-announces-first-approved-worker-proposals-prioritising-block-production-and-dac-toolkit)
    <br>I am a former investment banking and have had a successful independent corporate finance advisory practice for about 5 years, advising private equity, venture and corporate clients on M&A and strategy.
    <br>I was formerly regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority and remain an inactive member on their register.
    <br>Having seen from within the systemic failure of the banking system during the credit crisis, and its notable failure to show remorse or implement systemic changes, I am passionately and personally committed to the implementation of radical freedom as a means of empowering more people."

  <p id="idEosdacdfctrdsn">description::
    <br>"In order to function, DACs need tools that aren’t currently available.
    <br>eosDAC has created these tools and, through its commitment to open source software, will share them as a “DAC Factory” that anyone can take and use to set up and run a DAC.
    <br>The DAC Factory will evolve organically and over time and will include the core concepts of membership, voting, custodians, and proposals. Any account holding EOSDAC tokens can become a Member and get rights to benefit from the DAC, stand as a custodian, vote for custodians and submit proposals. Custodians are the DAC decision makers and will be continually voted for and held accountable by members. Proposals will be voted for by custodians and once approved (subject to available funds being available) will be implemented, checked and paid for. All proposals will provide some deliverables and benefits to the DAC ecosystem.
    <br>The DAC Factory will need to make sure that all of the different cogs of the DAC machine run smoothly.
    <br>Over time, other DAC structures and tools could be supported. It is also envisaged that other individuals, groups, and DACs will join and build upon the tools we create. Beyond software, the DAC Factory will also include best practices alongside legal and regulatory guidance for different jurisdictions. This will include a case study on eosDAC’s endeavors."

    <br>"The DAC Foundation can support projects aligned with its purpose on any chain. We’re cognisant that currently, the EOS.IO software is unique in being sophisticated enough to encode and transact the complex relationships needed to run a DAC.
    <br>DACs need to run on a blockchain that can support smart contracts – so a DAC could not run on bitcoin.
    <br>Beyond smart contracts, editable smart contracts are needed, since a complex functional organisational needs to be able to iterate its systems and processes over time. Ethereum allows for smart contracts but not editable smart contracts.
    <br>We’re happy to hear from you if you are DAC/DAO project on any chain that can support a DAC."

    <br>1. Keep running as a high quality block producer
    <br>2. Get the worker proposal system working on chain
    <br>3. Get new sources of profitable revenue
    <br>4. Keep existing developers and bring on board new developers
    <br>5. Look at ways to build value for the EOS community
    <br>6. Work towards a DAC focused eosio chain
    <br>7. Exercise prudent/efficient control of funds and reserves"

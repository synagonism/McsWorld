    <br><strong>Bitcoin
    <br>Refers to a protocol, network or a unit of currency</strong>.
    <br>
    <br>As a protocol, Bitcoin is a set of rules that every client must follow to accept transactions and have its own transactions accepted by other clients. Also includes a message protocol that allows nodes to connect to each other and exchange transactions and blocks.
    <br>
    <br><strong>As a network, Bitcoin is all the computers that follow the same rules and exchange transactions and blocks between each other</strong>.
    <br>
    <br>As a unit, one Bitcoin (BTC, XBT) is defined as 100 million satoshis, the smallest units available in the current transaction format. Bitcoin is not capitalized when speaking about the amount: "I received 0.4 bitcoins."

    <br>Bitcoin represents the culmination of decades of research in cryptography and distributed systems and includes four key innovations brought together in a unique and powerful combination.
    <br>Bitcoin consists of:
    <br>    A decentralized peer-to-peer network (the bitcoin protocol)
    <br>    A public transaction ledger (<a class="clsPreview" href="#idBtcbcndsn">the blockchain</a>)
    <br>    A decentralized mathematical and deterministic currency issuance (distributed mining)
    <br>    A decentralized transaction verification system (transaction script)

    <br>Bitcoin is <strong>two things</strong> which share a name:  1) a payment system and 2) a currency.  You use the Bitcoin payment system to send bitcoins as currency from one account holder to another. The transfer is instantaneous, carries no necessary fee, works anywhere in the world, and is private.

    <br>Some unusual terms are frequently used in Bitcoin documentation and discussions like *tx* or *coinbase*.
    <br>Or words like *scriptPubKey* were badly chosen and now deserve some extra explanation.

  <p id="idBtcattOaASIC">btc-ASIC:
    <br>Stands for "application-specific integrated circuit".
    <br>In other words, a chip designed to perform a narrow set of tasks (compared to CPU or GPU that perform a wide range of functions).
    <br>ASIC typically refers to specialized *<a class="clsPreview" href="#idBtc1Mining">mining</a>* chips <strong>or</strong> the whole machines built on these chips.
    <br>Some ASIC manufacturers: Avalon, ASICMiner, Butterfly Labs (BFL) and Cointerra.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcattOaASIC"></a></p>
  <p id="idBtcattOaASICMiner">btc-ASICMiner:
    <br>A Chinese manufacturer that makes custom mining hardware, sells shares for bitcoins, pays dividends from on-site mining and also ships actual hardware to customers.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcattOaASICMiner"></a></p>
  <p id="idBtcattOaBitcoin_ruby">btc-Bitcoin_ruby:
    <br>A Bitcoin utilities library in Ruby by Julian Langschaedel.
    <br>Used in production on *Coinbase.com*.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcattOaBitcoin_ruby"></a></p>
  <p id="idBtcattOaCasascius_Coin">btc-Casascious_Coins:
    <br>Physical collectible coins <a href="https://www.casascius.com">produced</a> by Mike Caldwell. Each coin contains a *private key* under a tamper-evident hologram. The name "Casascius" is formed from a phrase "call a spade a spade", as a response to a name of Bitcoin itself.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcattOaCasascius_Coin"></a></p>
  <p id="idBtcattOaCoin">btc-Coin:
    <br>An informal term that means either 1 bitcoin, or an unspent *transaction output* that can be *spent*.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcattOaCoin"></a></p>
  <p id="idBtcattOaCoinbase.com">btc-Coinbase.com:
    <br>US-based Bitcoin/USD exchange and web wallet service.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcattOaCoinbase.com"></a></p>
  <p id="idBtcattOaKey">btc-Key:
    <br>Could mean an ECDSA public or private key, or AES symmetric encryption key.
    <br>AES is not used in the protocol itself (only to encrypt the ECDSA keys and other sensitive data), so usually the word *key* means an ECDSA key.
    <br>When talking about *keys*, people usually mean private keys as public key can always be derived from a private one.
    <br>See also <a class="clsPreview" href="#idBtcprk">Private Key</a> and *Public Key*.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcattOaKey"></a></p>
  <p id="idBtcattOaMain_Chain">btc-Main_Chain:
    <br>A part of the blockchain which a node considers the most difficult (see <a class="clsPreview" href="#idBtcblkhdrnbtsdflt">difficulty</a>).
    <br>All nodes store all valid blocks, including <a class="clsPreview" href="#idBtcblkOrfn">orphans</a> and recompute the total difficulty when receiving another block.
    <br>If the newly arrived block or blocks do not extend existing main chain, but create another one from some previous block, it is called *reorganization*.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcattOaMain_Chain"></a></p>
  <p id="idBtcattOaMiner">btc-Miner:
    <br>A person, a software or a hardware that performs <a class="clsPreview" href="#idBtcmnng">mining</a>.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcattOaMiner"></a></p>
  <p id="idBtcattOaSecret_key">btc-Secret_key:
    <br>Either the *Private Key* or an encryption key used in encrypted *wallets*.
    <br>Bitcoin protocol does not use encryption anywhere, so *secret key* typically means a *private key* used for signing transactions.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcattOaSecret_key"></a></p>
  <p id="idBtcattOaSpam">
    <br>Incorrect peer-to-peer messages (like sending invalid transactions) may be considered a denial of service attack (see *DoS*).
    <br>Valid transactions sending very tiny amounts and/or having low *mining fees* are called <a class="clsPreview" href="#idBtctxDst">Dust</a> by some people.
    <br>The protocol itself does not define which transactions are not worth relaying or mining, it's a decision of every individual node.
    <br>Any valid transaction in the blockchain must be accepted by the node if it wishes to accept the remaining blocks, so transaction censorship only means increased confirmation delays.
    <br>Individual payees may also blacklist certain addresses (refuse to accept payments from some addresses), but that's too easy to work around using *mixing*.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcattOaSpam"></a></p>
  <p id="idBtcattOaVarInt">
    <br>VarInt:
    <br>This term may cause confusion as it means different formats in different Bitcoin implementations. See *CompactSize* for details.

  <p id="idBtcattCdDeflation">btc-Deflation:
    <br>The reduction of prices in an economy over time.
    <br>It happens when the supply of a good or service increases faster than the supply of money, or when the supply of money is finite, and decreases.
    <br>This leads to more goods or services per unit of currency, meaning that less currency is needed to purchase them.
    <br>This carries some downsides.
    <br>When people expect prices to fall, it causes them to stop spending and hoard money, in the hope that their money will go further later.
    <br>This can depress an economy.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcattCdDeflation"></a></p>
  <p id="idBtcattCdEscrow">btc-Escrow:

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcwpr0H3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idBtcwpr0P1">A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.
    <br>Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.
    <br>We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.
    <br>The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hashbased proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work.
    <br>The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power.
    <br>As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers.
    <br>The network itself requires minimal structure.
    <br>Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.

  <h3 id="idBtcwpr1H3">1. Introduction
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcwpr1H3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idBtcwpr1P1">Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments.
    <br>While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.
    <br>Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes.
    <br>The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible services.
    <br>With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads.
    <br>Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.
    <br>A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable.
    <br>These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcwpr1P1"></a></p>
  <p id="idBtcwpr1P2">What is needed is an electronic payment system based on <span class="clsU">cryptographic proof</span> instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.
    <br>Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers.
    <br>In this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions.
    <br><strong>The system is secure as long as <span class="clsU">honest nodes</span> collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of <span class="clsU">attacker nodes</span></strong>.

  <h3 id="idBtcwpr2H3">2. Transactions
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcwpr2H3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idBtcwpr2P1">We define <span class="clsU">an electronic coin</span> as a chain of digital signatures.
    <br>Each owner transfers the coin to the next by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner and adding these to the end of the coin.
    <br>A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of ownership.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcwpr2P1"></a></p>
  <p id="idBtcwprfig1">
    <br><img src="filMcsDtcnet.files/imgBtcwprFig1.png">
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcwprfig1"></a></p>
  <p id="idBtcwpr2P2">The problem of course is the payee can't verify that one of the owners did not double-spend the coin.
    <br>A common solution is to introduce a trusted central authority, or mint, that checks every transaction for double spending.
    <br>After each transaction, the coin must be returned to the mint to issue a new coin, and only coins issued directly from the mint are trusted not to be double-spent.
    <br>The problem with this solution is that the fate of the entire money system depends on the company running the mint, with every transaction having to go through them, just like a bank.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcwpr2P2"></a></p>
  <p id="idBtcwpr2P3">We need a way for the payee to know that the previous owners did not sign any earlier transactions.
    <br>For our purposes, the earliest transaction is the one that counts, so we don't care about later attempts to double-spend.
    <br><strong>The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to be aware of <span class="clsU">all</span> transactions</strong>.
    <br>In the mint based model, the mint was aware of all transactions and decided which arrived first.
    <br>To accomplish this without a trusted party, transactions must be publicly announced[<a class="clsPreview" href="#idBtcwprref1">01</a>], and we need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the order in which they were received.
    <br>The payee needs proof that at the time of each transaction, the majority of nodes agreed it was the first received.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcwpr3H3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idBtcwpr3P1">The solution we propose begins with <span class="clsColorRed">a timestamp server</span>.
    <br>A timestamp server works by taking a hash of a block of items to be timestamped and widely publishing the hash, such as in a newspaper or Usenet post[<a class="clsPreview" href="#idBtcwprref2">2-5</a>].
    <br>The timestamp proves that the data must have existed at the time, obviously, in order to get into the hash.
    <br>Each timestamp includes the previous timestamp in its hash, forming a chain, with each additional timestamp reinforcing the ones before it.

  <h3 id="idBtcwpr4H3">4. Proof-of-Work
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcwpr4H3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idBtcwpr4P1">To implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis, we will need to use a proof-of-work system similar to Adam Back's Hashcash[<a class="clsPreview" href="#idBtcwprref6">06</a>], rather than newspaper or Usenet posts.
    <br>The proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the hash begins with a number of zero bits.
    <br>The average work required is exponential in the number of zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcwpr4P1"></a></p>
  <p id="idBtcwpr4P2">For our timestamp network, we implement the proof-of-work by incrementing a nonce in the block until a value is found that gives the block's hash the required zero bits.
    <br>Once the CPU effort has been expended to make it satisfy the proof-of-work, the block cannot be changed without redoing the work.
    <br>As later blocks are chained after it, the work to change the block would include redoing all the blocks after it.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcwpr4P2"></a></p>
  <p id="idBtcwprfig3">
    <br><img src="filMcsDtcnet.files/imgBtcwprFig3.png">
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcwprfig3"></a></p>
  <p id="idBtcwpr4P3">The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making.
    <br>If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs.
    <br>Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote.
    <br>The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it.
    <br>If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains.
    <br>To modify a past block, an attacker would have to redo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the work of the honest nodes.
    <br>We will show later that the probability of a slower attacker catching up diminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcwpr4P3"></a></p>
  <p id="idBtcwpr4P4">To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour.
    <br>If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases.

  <h3 id="idBtcwpr5H3">5. Network
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcwpr5H3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idBtcwpr5P1">The steps to run the network are as follows:
    <br>1. New transactions are broadcast to all nodes.
    <br>2. Each node collects new transactions into a block.
    <br>3. Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block.
    <br>4. When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.
    <br>5. Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.
    <br>6. Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcwpr5P1"></a></p>
  <p id="idBtcwpr5P2">Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on extending it.
    <br>If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some nodes may receive one or the other first.
    <br>In that case, they work on the first one they received, but save the other branch in case it becomes longer.
    <br>The tie will be broken when the next proof-of-work is found and one branch becomes longer; the nodes that were working on the other branch will then switch to the longer one.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcwpr5P2"></a></p>
  <p id="idBtcwpr5P3">New transaction broadcasts do not necessarily need to reach all nodes.
    <br>As long as they reach many nodes, they will get into a block before long.
    <br>Block broadcasts are also tolerant of dropped messages.
    <br>If a node does not receive a block, it will request it when it receives the next block and realizes it missed one.

  <h3 id="idBtcwpr6H3">6. Incentive
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcwpr6H3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idBtcwpr6P1">By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned by the creator of the block.
    <br>This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides a way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them.
    <br>The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation.
    <br>In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcwpr6P1"></a></p>
  <p id="idBtcwpr6P2">The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees.
    <br>If the output value of a transaction is less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of the block containing the transaction. <strong>Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free</strong>.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcwpr6P2"></a></p>
  <p id="idBtcwpr6P3">The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest.
    <br>If a greedy attacker is able to assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins.
    <br>He ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcwpr7H3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idBtcwpr7P1">Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before it can be discarded to save disk space.
    <br>To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash, transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [<a class="clsPreview" href="#idBtcwprref7">7</a>][<a class="clsPreview" href="#idBtcwprref2">2</a>][<a class="clsPreview" href="#idBtcwprref5">5</a>], with only the root included in the block's hash.
    <br>Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree.
    <br>The interior hashes do not need to be stored.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcwprfig4"></a></p>
  <p id="idBtcwpr7P2">A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes.
    <br>If we suppose blocks are generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year.
    <br>With computer systems typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of 1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in memory.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcwpr8H3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idBtcwpr8P1">It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node.
    <br>A user only needs to keep a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying network nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch linking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in.
    <br>He can't check the transaction for himself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it, and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it.

  <p id="idBtcwpr8P2">As such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more vulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker.
    <br>While network nodes can verify transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network.
    <br>One strategy to protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid block, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to confirm the inconsistency.
    <br>Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcwpr9H3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idBtcwpr9P1">Although it would be possible to handle coins individually, it would be unwieldy to make a separate transaction for every cent in a transfer.
    <br>To allow value to be split and combined, transactions contain multiple inputs and outputs.
    <br>Normally there will be either a single input from a larger previous transaction or multiple inputs combining smaller amounts, and at most two outputs: one for the payment, and one returning the change, if any, back to the sender.

  <p id="idBtcwpr9P2">It should be noted that fan-out, where a transaction depends on several transactions, and those transactions depend on many more, is not a problem here.
    <br>There is never the need to extract a complete standalone copy of a transaction's history.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcwpr10H3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idBtcwpr10P1">The traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the parties involved and the trusted third party.
    <br>The necessity to announce all transactions publicly precludes this method, but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in another place: by keeping public keys anonymous.
    <br>The public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone.
    <br>This is similar to the level of information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of individual trades, the "tape", is made public, but without telling who the parties were.

  <p id="idBtcwpr10P2">As an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner.
    <br>Some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner.
    <br>The risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same owner.

  <h3 id="idBtcwpr11H3">11. Calculations
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcwpr11H3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idBtcwpr11P1">We consider the scenario of an attacker trying to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest chain.
    <br>Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker.
    <br>Nodes are not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block containing them.
    <br>An attacker can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back money he recently spent.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcwpr11P1"></a></p>
  <p id="idBtcwpr11P2">The race between the honest chain and an attacker chain can be characterized as a Binomial Random Walk.
    <br>The success event is the honest chain being extended by one block, increasing its lead by +1, and the failure event is the attacker's chain being extended by one block, reducing the gap by -1.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcwpr11P2"></a></p>
  <p id="idBtcwpr11P3">The probability of an attacker catching up from a given deficit is analogous to a Gambler's Ruin problem.
    <br>Suppose a gambler with unlimited credit starts at a deficit and plays potentially an infinite number of trials to try to reach breakeven.
    <br>We can calculate the probability he ever reaches breakeven, or that an attacker ever catches up with the honest chain, as follows[<a class="clsPreview" href="#idBtcwprref8">8</a>]:
    <br>
    <br><img src="filMcsDtcnet.files/imgBtcwprFig8.png">
    <br>
    <br>Given our assumption that p>q, the probability drops exponentially as the number of blocks the attacker has to catch up with increases.
    <br>With the odds against him, if he doesn't make a lucky lunge forward early on, his chances become vanishingly small as he falls further behind.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcwpr11P3"></a></p>
  <p id="idBtcwpr11P4">We now consider how long the recipient of a new transaction needs to wait before being sufficiently certain the sender can't change the transaction.
    <br>We assume the sender is an attacker who wants to make the recipient believe he paid him for a while, then switch it to pay back to himself after some time has passed.
    <br>The receiver will be alerted when that happens, but the sender hopes it will be too late.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcwpr11P4"></a></p>
  <p id="idBtcwpr11P5">The receiver generates a new key pair and gives the public key to the sender shortly before signing.
    <br>This prevents the sender from preparing a chain of blocks ahead of time by working on it continuously until he is lucky enough to get far enough ahead, then executing the transaction at that moment.
    <br>Once the transaction is sent, the dishonest sender starts working in secret on a parallel chain containing an alternate version of his transaction.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcwpr11P5"></a></p>
  <div id="idBtcwpr11P6">
    <p>The recipient waits until the transaction has been added to a block and z blocks have been linked after it.
    <br>He doesn't know the exact amount of progress the attacker has made, but assuming the honest blocks took the average expected time per block, the attacker's potential progress will be a Poisson distribution with expected value:
    <br>
    <br><img src="filMcsDtcnet.files/imgBtcwprFig9.png">
    <br>
    <br>To get the probability the attacker could still catch up now, we multiply the Poisson density for each amount of progress he could have made by the probability he could catch up from that point:
    <br>
    <br><img src="filMcsDtcnet.files/imgBtcwprFig10.png">
    <br>

  <h3 id="idBtcwpr12H3">12. Conclusion
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcwpr12H3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idBtcwpr12P1">We have proposed a system for <strong>electronic transactions without relying on trust</strong>.
    <br>We started with the usual framework of <strong>coins made from digital signatures</strong>, which provides strong control of ownership, but is incomplete without a way to prevent double-spending.
    <br>To solve this, we proposed a peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to record <strong>a public history of transactions</strong> that quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker to change if honest nodes control a majority of CPU power.
    <br>The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity.
    <br>Nodes work all at once with little coordination.
    <br>They do not need to be identified, since messages are not routed to any particular place and only need to be delivered on a best effort basis.
    <br>Nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.
    <br><strong>They vote with their CPU power</strong>, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them.
    <br>Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this <span class="clsColorRed">consensus mechanism</span>.

    <br>The lightning network is a highly anticipated <span class="clsU">second-layer protocol</span> to be rolled out on top of Bitcoin’s blockchain. Cleverly utilizing Bitcoin’s programmable elements (like multisignature and time-locks), lightning users should be able to make a virtually unlimited number of off-chain transactions with instant confirmations and at low cost. This should boost Bitcoin’s micropayment-ability, overall scalability and even privacy.

    <br>Announcing the Thunder Network Alpha Release
    <br>Peter · May 16, 2016 · Leave a Reply
    <br>At Blockchain, we’re on a mission to create an open, accessible, and equitable financial future. Since our inception, we have focused on building products that make it easy for everyday people to use bitcoin to store and transfer value all over the world. We make Bitcoin usable and useful. We’ve been able to do that because we develop with a user-focused mandate.
    <br>
    <br>A faster, cheaper, and more functional network would deliver real value to our users, so we were excited by the growth of research into payment channel technology on the bitcoin network and innovative uses of this technology. We were particularly interested in the idea of using smart contracts to build what are basically super-charged payments networks, as outlined in a white paper by the lightning.network team. Last year, we hired a talented engineer, Mats Jerratsch, who had been pioneering innovation in this vertical to work with our engineering team and lead research and development on a network based around these ideas.
    <br>
    <br>Lightning networks have been purely conceptual, research based, and only in test nets and labs – until now. Today, we release the alpha version of our Thunder Network, the first usable implementation of the Lightning network for off chain bitcoin payments that settles back to the main bitcoin blockchain.
    <br>
    <br>We used it internally a few days ago. Click here to learn all about Transaction 0 between Mats and me.
    <br>
    <br>Thunder has the potential to facilitate secure, trustless, and instant payments. It has the ability to unleash the power of microtransactions, to allow the bitcoin network to handle heavy loads, and to increase user privacy. In this Alpha version, we prove that it can be done. From a feature perspective, there is both a node and a wallet (with GUI) present. Even more importantly:
    <br>
    <br>Settlement to the bitcoin blockchain
    <br>Scale: According to our tests so far, we can achieve better-than-Visa scale (100,000 TPS) with only a few thousand nodes on the network
    <br>Extremely cheap payments: fees will develop naturally, due to the free market in an open and permissionless network and will fundamentally be lower than on-chain payments
    <br>Encryption and Authentication: All communications between all nodes and wallets are encrypted using AES-CTR and take place only after completing authentication.
    <br>Seed Peers and automatically provide them with network topology using a basic gossip protocol similar to the one used in the bitcoin network, which allows complex routes over multiple hops
    <br>Payment Channels can be opened and closed at will, with transactions settling onto the bitcoin blockchain
    <br>Payment Debate: Across the route each hop will renegotiate a new status with the next hop, as a payment makes its way through the network with cryptography in place to prevent fraud
    <br>Relaying Payments: TN will relay payments over multiple nodes in the network automatically, using encrypted routing. No one knows who made a payment, allowing for more privacy
    <br>Settle payments automatically, no manual intervention needed. The settlement will ripple back through the network to provide proof-of-payment
    <br>Instant Payments that are irrevocable the moment you see them
    <br>Until both CSV and SegWit are implemented on the bitcoin blockchain, transactions are not enforceable at the bitcoin protocol level. So, the current Thunder prototype is best suited for transactions among a trusted network of users. Try this amongst your dev team or amongst your trusted internet friends, but don’t use it for real payments. Remember: this is alpha testing software.
    <br>
    <br>So why release this now? We believe it is critical to get something in the hands of users as soon as possible to gain feedback that will enable us to be ready when the network is. So review it, test it out, open an issue on GitHub, or send us an email. If you want to work on tech like this full time, head here and apply to join our team.

    <br>All full nodes implement the same peer-to-peer messaging protocol to exchange transactions and blocks, but that is not a requirement.
    <br>A full node may receive and validate data using any protocol and from any source.

    <br>===
    <br>A full node is defined as <strong>a network-attached</strong> bitcoin client application, such as the original bitcoin Core (QT) client or an implementation of the bitcoind framework. A full node has the entire, up-to-date set of blockchain files, and also has port 8333 open, so it is set to listen for incoming requests. This list is very specific, and all of these conditions must be met for it to be a useful full node.

    <br>===
    <br>A full node is <span class="clsBU">a program</span> that fully validates transactions and blocks. Almost all full nodes also help the network by accepting transactions and blocks from other full nodes, validating those transactions and blocks, and then relaying them to further full nodes.
    <br>Most full nodes also serve lightweight clients by allowing them to transmit their transactions to the network and by notifying them when a transaction affects their wallet. If not enough nodes perform this function, clients won’t be able to connect through the peer-to-peer network—they’ll have to use centralized services instead.
    <br>Many people and organizations volunteer to run full nodes using spare computing and bandwidth resources—but more volunteers are needed to allow Bitcoin to continue to grow. This document describes how you can help and what helping will cost you.

    <br>Minimum Requirements
    <br>Bitcoin Core full nodes have certain requirements. If you try running a node on weak hardware, it may work—but you’ll likely spend more time dealing with issues. If you can meet the following requirements, you’ll have an easy-to-use node.
    <br>
    <br>Desktop or laptop hardware running recent versions of Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux.
    <br>
    <br>50 gigabytes of free disk space
    <br>
    <br>2 gigabytes of memory (RAM)
    <br>
    <br>A broadband Internet connection with upload speeds of at least 400 kilobits (50 kilobytes) per second
    <br>
    <br>An unmetered connection, a connection with high upload limits, or a connection you regularly monitor to ensure it doesn’t exceed its upload limits. It’s common for full nodes on high-speed connections to use 200 gigabytes upload or more a month. Download usage is around 20 gigabytes a month, plus around an additional 40 gigabytes the first time you start your node.
    <br>
    <br>6 hours a day that your full node can be left running. (You can do other things with your computer while running a full node.) More hours would be better, and best of all would be if you can run your node continuously.
    <br>
    <br>Note: many operating systems today (Windows, Mac, and Linux) enter a low-power mode after the screensaver activates, slowing or halting network traffic. This is often the default setting on laptops and on all Mac OS X laptops and desktops. Check your screensaver settings and disable automatic “sleep” or “suspend” options to ensure you support the network whenever your computer is running.

    <br>Lightweight client
    <br>Comparing to a full node, <strong>lightweight node</strong> does not store the whole blockchain and thus cannot fully verify any transaction.
    <br>There are two kinds of lightweight nodes: those fully trusting an external service to determine wallet balance and validity of transactions (e.g. blockchain.info) and the apps implementing Simplified Payment Verification (SPV).
    <br>SPV clients do not need to trust any particular service, but are more vulnerable to a 51% attack than full nodes. See Simplified Payment Verification for more info.

    <br>===
    <br>A protocol known as “simplified payment verification” (SPV) allows for another class of nodes to exist, called “light nodes”, which download the block headers, verify the proof of work on the block headers, and then download only the “branches” associated with transactions that are relevant to them.
    <br>This allows light nodes to determine with a strong guarantee of security what the status of any Bitcoin transaction, and their current balance, is while downloading only a very small portion of the entire blockchain.

  <p id="idBtcbcnP2">description::
    <br>A block chain is <strong>a transaction database</strong> shared by all nodes participating in a system based on the Bitcoin protocol. A full copy of a currency's block chain contains every transaction ever executed in the currency. With this information, one can find out how much value belonged to each address at any point in history.
    <br>
    <br>Every block contains a hash of the previous block. This has the effect of creating a chain of blocks from the genesis block to the current block. Each block is guaranteed to come after the previous block chronologically because the previous block's hash would otherwise not be known. Each block is also computationally impractical to modify once it has been in the chain for a while because every block after it would also have to be regenerated. These properties are what make double-spending of bitcoins very difficult. The block chain is the main innovation of Bitcoin.
    <br>
    <br>Honest generators only build onto a block (by referencing it in blocks they create) if it is the latest block in the longest valid chain. "Length" is calculated as total combined difficulty of that chain, not number of blocks, though this distinction is only important in the context of a few potential attacks. A chain is valid if all of the blocks and transactions within it are valid, and only if it starts with the genesis block.
    <br>
    <br>For any block on the chain, there is only one path to the genesis block. Coming from the genesis block, however, there can be forks. One-block forks are created from time to time when two blocks are created just a few seconds apart. When that happens, generating nodes build onto whichever one of the blocks they received first. Whichever block ends up being included in the next block becomes part of the main chain because that chain is longer. More serious forks have occurred after fixing bugs that required backward-incompatible changes.
    <br>
    <br>Blocks in shorter chains (or invalid chains) are not used for anything. When the bitcoin client switches to another, longer chain, all valid transactions of the blocks inside the shorter chain are re-added to the pool of queued transactions and will be included in another block. The reward for the blocks on the shorter chain will not be present in the longest chain, so they will be practically lost, which is why a network-enforced 100-block maturation time for generations exists.
    <br>
    <br>These blocks on the shorter chains are often called "orphan" blocks. This is because the generation transactions do not have a parent block in the longest chain, so these generation transactions show up as orphan in the listtransactions RPC call. Several pools have misinterpreted these messages and started calling their blocks "orphans". In reality, these blocks have a parent block, and might even have children.
    <br>
    <br>Because a block can only reference one previous block, it is impossible for two forked chains to merge.
    <br>
    <br>It's possible to use the block chain algorithm for non-financial purposes: see Alternative chain.
    <br>
    <br>The block chain is broadcast to all nodes on the networking using a flood protocol: see Block chain download.

    <br>Blockchain is the system that bitcoin inventors devised. To understand how blockchain works requires dedicated study, but non-specialists might think of it as a publicly viewable spreadsheet that records every bitcoin transaction — who sent how much to whom (it's possible to remain fairly anonymous). Every few minutes, a "block" of new rows is added. But old blocks on the chain can't be edited. They're locked tight by theoretically unbreakable computer code.
    <br>
    <br>See the most-read stories this hour >>
    <br>At least thousands of specially set up computers store a copy of the blockchain, so messing with records would require the herculean feat of infecting them all. Anyone can set up one of these computers, which work together to find inconsistencies and prevent fraud like double-spending. The people and businesses around the world who have set up these computers collect fees in exchange for authorizing transactions.
    <br>
    <br>Finding applications for blockchain is wide-open territory right now. Factom, an organization in Austin, Texas, proposes using it to verify and lock down the records on mortgage contracts, with the aim of preventing some of the abuses of the mortgage meltdown, where signatures were faked and mortgage contracts went missing.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcblkhdrnbtsdfltH5"></a></h5>
  <p id="idBtcblkhdrnbtsdfltdsn">description::
    <br>Difficulty is a measure of how difficult it is to find a new block compared to the easiest it can ever be.
    <br>By definition, it is a maximum *<a class="clsPreview" href="#idBtcblkhdrnbtsdsn">target</a>* divided by the current target.
    <br>Difficulty is used in two Bitcoin rules:
    <br>1) every block must be meet difficulty target to ensure 10 minute interval between blocks and
    <br>2) transactions are considered confirmed only when belonging to a *main chain* which is the one with the biggest cumulative difficulty of all blocks.
    <br>As of July 27, 2014 the difficulty is 18 736 441 558 and grows by 3-5% every two weeks.
    <br>See also *Target*.

    <br>===
    <br>The contents of the block are then hashed with an incrementing random number (called a “nonce”) until the resulting output contains a certain number of leading zeroes.
    <br>The network dynamically adjusts the requisite number of leading zeroes (or the “difficulty”) so that a block is mined every 10 minutes on average.
    <br>Because the results of hashing algorithms are unpredictable, finding a valid hash which the rest of the network will accept requires both luck and CPU power.
    <br>[<a href="https://media.consensys.net/time-sure-does-fly-ed4518792679#.rjkzhxgwo">https://media.consensys.net/time-sure-does-fly-ed4518792679#.rjkzhxgwo</a>]
    <br>===
    <br>What is the formula for difficulty?
    <br>difficulty = difficulty_1_target / current_target
    <br>(target is a 256 bit number)
    <br>difficulty_1_target can be different for various ways to measure difficulty. Traditionally, it represents a hash where the leading 32 bits are zero and the rest are one (this is known as "pool difficulty" or "pdiff"). The Bitcoin protocol represents targets as a custom floating point type with limited precision; as a result, Bitcoin clients often approximate difficulty based on this (this is known as "bdiff").
    <br>[<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty#What_is_the_formula_for_difficulty.3F">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty#What_is_the_formula_for_difficulty.3F</a>]
    <br>===
    <br>This number determines how difficult it is to hash a new block.
    <br>It is related to the maximum allowed number in a given numerical portion of a transaction block’s hash.
    <br>The lower the number, the more difficult it is to produce a hash value that fits it.
    <br>Difficulty varies based on the amount of computing power used by miners on the bitcoin network.
    <br>If large numbers of miners leave a network, the difficulty would decrease.
    <br>Thus far, however, bitcoin’s growing popularity has attracted more computing power to the network, meaning that the difficulty has increased.

    <br>A 32-bit number in a *block header* which is iterated during a search for proof-of-work.
    <br>Each time the nonce is changed, the *hash* of the block header is recalculated.
    <br>If nonce overflows before valid proof-of-work is found, an *extra nonce* is incremented and placed in the *coinbase* script.

    <br>===
    <br>To create different hash values from the same data, Bitcoin uses "nonces".
    <br>A nonce is just a random number that's added to data prior to hashing.
    <br>Changing the nonce results in a wildly different hash value.

    <br>===
    <br>Nonce:
    <br><strong>A random string of data</strong> used as an input when hashing a transaction block.
    <br>A nonce is used to try and produce a digest that fits the numerical parameters set by the bitcoin difficulty.
    <br>A different nonce will be used with each hashing attempt, meaning that billions of nonces are generated when attempting to hash each transaction block.

    <br>===
    <br>The nonce field contains <strong>arbitrary data</strong> and is used as a source of randomness for solving the proof of work problem.
    <br>However, since it is fairly small in size with 4 bytes, it does not necessarily provide sufficient variation for finding a solution.
    <br>Therefore, other sources exist and will be addressed in more detail in Sect. 5.2.

    <br>This isn’t the first time bitcoin community members attempted to change the block size limit. Originally, there was no block size limit. The current limit was introduced early on to protect the system against “spam transactions.” At the time, it wasn’t a big deal since few people were using bitcoin. The one megabyte limit was like a 500 MPH speed limit. It was completely non-binding. But the system has grown a lot since then. Although it’s not yet bumping up against the hard constraint—it averaged around 117,500 transactions per day over the last month—many believe the block size limit will become binding in the very near future.
    <br>...
    <br>There’s a related concern that bigger block sizes will require more bandwidth, which would preclude some smaller players from competing in the mining race. Opponents claim this, too, would result in a more centralized system.

    <br>BitPay Supports Increase in Bitcoin Block Size Limit
    <br>Posted on August 23, 2015Author Gautham
    <br>BitPay Supports Increase in Bitcoin Block Size Limit.
    <br>BitPay, the largest bitcoin payment processor has sided with Gavin Andresen’s court by showing its support towards incorporation of BIP 101. In other words, BitPay in one of their blog posts mentioned that the company supports the move to increase bitcoin block size from 1 MB to 8 MB (which is known as BIP 101).
    <br>
    <br>Bitcoin XT has been a topic of serious debate among the bitcoin community for a while now. The debate has ranged ever since Gavin Andresen, the Chief Scientist at Bitcoin Foundation and Mike Hearn proposed Bitcoin XT a few months ago.
    <br>
    <br>The Bitcoin XT proposal was later changed to incorporate a few changes after receiving inputs from members of the bitcoin community. While there are few who are in favor of a 7MB increase in the bitcoin block size, there are others who are opposed to this idea. The bitcoin block size limit is currently 1 MB, which Bitcoin XT proposed to change to 8 MB. Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn finally launched a Bitcoin XT fork few days ago. The launch didn’t go will with many bitcoin based entities who are also part of the club.
    <br>
    <br>The bitcoin network has experienced rapid growth since its inception in 2009. At the current rate of growth, the bitcoin network with 1 MB block size limit will be left obsolete by 2017.
    <br>
    <br>BitPay has put forward a sensible argument as to why BIP 101 has to be incorporated while expressing its support towards its integration into bitcoin core client. Contrary to the opinions of a few people, BitPay believes that the integration of BIP 101 will not compromise the integrity of the Bitcoin network. BIP 101 will instead protect the decentralized nature of the bitcoin network. BitPay sees the current argument against integration of BIP 101 to be favoring a centralized group of developers, which if continued will compromise the decentralized nature of the bitcoin network. Increased block size limit will prevent big mining companies from running a full bitcoin node, thereby preserving the decentralized nature of bitcoin.
    <br>
    <br>To summarize in the words of Stephen Pair, the CEO and co-founder of BitPay — BIP 101 will safeguard bitcoin’s decentralized nature while providing reliable, immediate path towards greater network throughput and BitPay supports merging BIP 101 into Bitcoin Core.

    <br>A spat between developers may split the digital currency
    <br>The project approaches a "fork" in the road
    <br>Aug 18th 2015 | Business and finance
    <br>
    <br>"FEDERAL Reserve deeply split. Renegade group of board members to create separate American dollar.” Such a headline seems highly unlikely, but this in essence is happening in the land of bitcoin, the digital currency. On August 15th two of bitcoin’s five main developers released a competing version, or “fork”, of the software that powers the currency—a move, some fear, that may split bitcoin.
    <br>
    <br>The dispute is predictably arcane. The bone of contention is the size of a “block”, a batch of bitcoin transactions into which these are assembled before they are processed. Satoshi Nakamoto, the elusive creator of bitcoin who went offline in 2011, limited their size to 1Mb. That is enough to handle about 300,000 transactions per day—suitable for a currency used mainly by crypto-geeks, as bitcoin once was, but nowhere near enough to rival conventional payment systems. The likes of Visa and MasterCard can process tens of thousands of payments per second if needed.
    <br>
    <br>Related topics
    <br>Bitcoins
    <br>By how much and when to increase this limit has long been a matter of a heated debate within the bitcoin community. One camp wants to set the number much higher and do it soon. Otherwise, they argue, the system could crash as it runs out of capacity as early as next year. Transactions could take hours to confirm and fees could rocket, warns Mike Hearn, a leading bitcoin developer. “Bitcoin would survive,” he wrote in a blog post in May, “but it would have lost critical momentum.”
    <br>
    <br>The other side, led by the other three main bitcoin developers, frets that increasing the block size hastily would lead to centralisation and turn bitcoin into more of a conventional payment system. This matters to bitcoin purists, who laud the currency’s decentralised approach of running a currency. The system currently relies on thousands of independent “nodes”, computers spread across the world that check whether blocks of transactions are valid and keep tabs on who owns which bitcoins. Increasing the size of these blocks would make the system so unwieldy as to dissuade nodes from participating, so hastening a worrying recent decline in participants.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>How Bitcoin works
    <br>The dispute is as ideological as it is technical. The bitcoin community has a process to settle such controversies, but it is by design slow and produces decisions only when everybody is happy. Frustrated that the discussion has kept dragging on, Mr Hearn and Gavin Andresen, one of the dissenting developers, decided to press the issue by organising a referendum of sorts: they have called on “miners”, specialised nodes that assemble the blocks and mint new bitcoin, to install their new version, called “Bitcoin XT”.
    <br>
    <br>Once at least 75% of the blocks are processed by Bitcoin XT, but no earlier than January, it will upgrade to a block size of a maximum of 8Mb (and double that limit every two years). The nodes that then still run the old “Bitcoin Core” software would find themselves excluded from the system.
    <br>
    <br>Predictably, the move has increased the temperature of the debate. On discussion sites such as Reddit, moderators have censored mentions of Bitcoin XT because they see it as an effort to undermine the bitcoin community. Comments purportedly made by Mr Nakamoto warning that a fork would lead him to “declare bitcoin a failed project” have been widely dismissed as a hoax.
    <br>
    <br>Despite all the sound and fury, such an outcome is still unlikely. Like spatting doves and hawks at an old-fashioned central bank, the two sides will probably agree on some compromise; two fun-sounding “Bitcoin Scalability Workshops” have been scheduled for later this year.
    <br>
    <br>Even if miners get to make the decision, this would probably not lead to a bitcoin split. Once it becomes clear which version is likely to prevail, all miners will have an incentive to jump on the winning bandwagon. Already, 8% of them have joined the dissident XT faction, a rapid take-up. Whether such a majority rule is the best way to run the highly complex bitcoin system, however, is an entirely different question.

    <br>Mining:
    <br><strong>The act</strong> of generating new bitcoins by solving cryptographic problems using computing hardware.

    <br>===
    <br>Central to Bitcoin’s architecture is a public ledger called the blockchain, which stores all processed transactions in chronological order.
    <br>Transactions are processed by a loosely organized network of miners in a process called mining (see Sect. 5.2).
    <br>In it the miner creates a block with a set of unprocessed transactions and attempts to solve a proof of work puzzle (see Sect. 2.1).
    <br><strong>Once a valid solution has been found, the block including the solution is published throughout the network and accepted into the blockchain</strong>.

    <br>===
    <br>Mining:
    <br>A process of finding valid *hashes* of a block header by iterating millions of variants of block headers (using *nonce* and *extra nonce*) in order to find a hash lower than the *target* (see also *difficulty*).
    <br>The process needs to determine a single global history of all transactions (grouped in blocks).
    <br>Mining consumes time and electricity and nowadays the difficulty is so big, that energy-wise it's not even profitable to mine using video graphics cards.
    <br>Mining is paid for by *transaction fees* and by block *rewards* (newly generated coins, hence the term "mining").

  <p id="idBtcmnngP1">Doing::
    <br>As described in [9], mining nodes perform the following
    <br>steps in an endless loop:
    <br>1) Collect all broadcasted transactions and validate whether they satisfy the miner’s
    <br>self-defined policy. Typically, a transaction includes a transaction fee that functions
    <br>as an incentive for the miner to include it in the block. However, if it does
    <br>not, then it is up to the miner to decide whether or not to include it.
    <br>2) Verify all transactions that are to be included in the block. Transactions are
    <br>verified as described in Sect. 4.2 and it is checked whether their inputs have been
    <br>previously spent.
    <br>3) Select the most recent block on the longest path in the blockchain, i.e. the path
    <br>that involves most accumulated computational effort, and insert the hash of the
    <br>block header into the new block.
    <br>4) Solve the proof of work problem as described below and broadcast the solution.
    <br>Should another node solve the proof of work problem before, then the block is
    <br>first validated, meaning the proof of work solution is checked and all transactions
    <br>included in the block are verified. If it passes these controls then the cycle is
    <br>repeated. Note that if there are transactions that have not been included in the
    <br>new block then they are saved and included in the next cycle.

    <br>A service that allows separate owners of mining hardware to split the reward proportionally to submitted work.
    <br>Since probability of finding a valid block hash is proportional to miner's *hashrate*, small individual miners may work for months before finding a big per-block reward.
    <br>Mining pools allow more steady stream of smaller income.

    <br>Pool:
    <br>A collection of mining clients which collectively mine a block, and then split the reward between them.

    <br>
    <br>What is a Mining Pool?
    <br>Mining, once done on the average home computer, is now mostly done in large, specialized warehouses. These warehouses usually direct their hashing power towards mining pools. What is a mining pool? Here’s the definition from Buy Bitcoin Worldwide:
    <br>
    <br>Mining pools are groups of cooperating miners who agree to share block rewards in proportion to their contributed mining hashing power. While mining pools are desirable to the average miner as they smooth out rewards and make them more predictable, they unfortunately concentrate power to the mining pool’s owner. Miners can, however, choose to redirect their hashing power to a different mining pool at anytime.
    <br>
    <br>While we can see which mining pools are the largest, it’s important to understand that the hash power pointed towards a mining pool isn’t necessarily owned by the mining pool itself. There are a few cases, like with BitFury and KnCMiner, where the company itself runs the mining operation but doesn’t run a mining pool.
    <br>
    <br>Bitcoin miners can switch mining pools easily by routing their hash power to a different pool. The market share of pools is constantly changing. To make the list of top 10 miners, we looked at blocks found over the past 6 months using data from BlockTrail. The size of mining pools is constantly changing. We will do our best to keep this posted up-to-date. Note that if you cloud mine then you don’t need to select a pool; the cloud mining company does this automatically.

    <br><strong>A block chain reorganize (or reorg)</strong> happens when one chain becomes longer than the one you are currently working on.

    <br>Genesis block
    <br>A genesis block is the first block of a block chain.
    <br>Modern versions of Bitcoin assign it block number 0, though older versions gave it number 1.
    <br>The genesis block is almost always hardcoded into the software.
    <br>It is a special case in that it does not reference a previous block, and for Bitcoin and almost all of its derivatives, it produces an unspendable <a class="clsPreview" href="#idBtcblkrwdsbsddsn">subsidy</a>.

    <br>Genesis_Block:
    <br>A very first block in the blockchain with hard-coded contents and a all-zero reference to a previous block.
    <br>Genesis block was released on 3rd of January 2009 with a newspaper quote in its <a class="clsPreview" href="#idBtctxinpcnbs">coinbase</a>:
    <br>"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks" as a proof that there are no secretly pre-mined blocks to overtake the blockchain in the future.
    <br>The message ironically refers to a reason for Bitcoin existence: a constant inflation of money supply by governments and banks.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcbcncsaH2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idBtcbcncsadsn">description::
    <br>The algorithm for checking if a block is valid, expressed in this paradigm, is as follows:
    <br>
    <br>Check if the previous block referenced by the block exists and is valid.
    <br>Check that the timestamp of the block is greater than that of the previous block[2] and less than 2 hours into the future
    <br>Check that the proof of work on the block is valid.
    <br>Let S[0] be the state at the end of the previous block.
    <br>Suppose TX is the block's transaction list with n transactions. For all i in 0...n-1, set S[i+1] = APPLY(S[i],TX[i]) If any application returns an error, exit and return false.
    <br>Return true, and register S[n] as the state at the end of this block.
    <br>Essentially, each transaction in the block must provide a valid state transition from what was the canonical state before the transaction was executed to some new state. Note that the state is not encoded in the block in any way; it is purely an abstraction to be remembered by the validating node and can only be (securely) computed for any block by starting from the genesis state and sequentially applying every transaction in every block. Additionally, note that the order in which the miner includes transactions into the block matters; if there are two transactions A and B in a block such that B spends a UTXO created by A, then the block will be valid if A comes before B but not otherwise.
    <br>
    <br>The one validity condition present in the above list that is not found in other systems is the requirement for "proof of work". The precise condition is that the double-SHA256 hash of every block, treated as a 256-bit number, must be less than a dynamically adjusted target, which as of the time of this writing is approximately 2187. The purpose of this is to make block creation computationally "hard", thereby preventing sybil attackers from remaking the entire blockchain in their favor. Because SHA256 is designed to be a completely unpredictable pseudorandom function, the only way to create a valid block is simply trial and error, repeatedly incrementing the nonce and seeing if the new hash matches.
    <br>
    <br>At the current target of ~2187, the network must make an average of ~269 tries before a valid block is found; in general, the target is recalibrated by the network every 2016 blocks so that on average a new block is produced by some node in the network every ten minutes. In order to compensate miners for this computational work, the miner of every block is entitled to include a transaction giving themselves 25 BTC out of nowhere. Additionally, if any transaction has a higher total denomination in its inputs than in its outputs, the difference also goes to the miner as a "transaction fee". Incidentally, this is also the only mechanism by which BTC are issued; the genesis state contained no coins at all.
    <br>
    <br>In order to better understand the purpose of mining, let us examine what happens in the event of a malicious attacker. Since Bitcoin's underlying cryptography is known to be secure, the attacker will target the one part of the Bitcoin system that is not protected by cryptography directly: the order of transactions. The attacker's strategy is simple:
    <br>
    <br>Send 100 BTC to a merchant in exchange for some product (preferably a rapid-delivery digital good)
    <br>Wait for the delivery of the product
    <br>Produce another transaction sending the same 100 BTC to himself
    <br>Try to convince the network that his transaction to himself was the one that came first.
    <br>Once step (1) has taken place, after a few minutes some miner will include the transaction in a block, say block number 270000. After about one hour, five more blocks will have been added to the chain after that block, with each of those blocks indirectly pointing to the transaction and thus "confirming" it. At this point, the merchant will accept the payment as finalized and deliver the product; since we are assuming this is a digital good, delivery is instant. Now, the attacker creates another transaction sending the 100 BTC to himself. If the attacker simply releases it into the wild, the transaction will not be processed; miners will attempt to run APPLY(S,TX) and notice that TX consumes a UTXO which is no longer in the state. So instead, the attacker creates a "fork" of the blockchain, starting by mining another version of block 270000 pointing to the same block 269999 as a parent but with the new transaction in place of the old one. Because the block data is different, this requires redoing the proof of work. Furthermore, the attacker's new version of block 270000 has a different hash, so the original blocks 270001 to 270005 do not "point" to it; thus, the original chain and the attacker's new chain are completely separate. The rule is that in a fork the longest blockchain is taken to be the truth, and so legitimate miners will work on the 270005 chain while the attacker alone is working on the 270000 chain. In order for the attacker to make his blockchain the longest, he would need to have more computational power than the rest of the network combined in order to catch up (hence, "51% attack").

    <br>A proof of work is <strong>a cryptographic puzzle</strong> used to ensure that a party has performed a certain amount of work.
    <br>In particular, the Bitcoin mining process (see Sect. 5.2) incorporates a proof of work system based on Adam Back’s Hashcash [3].
    <br>It has two basic properties - firstly, it ensures that the party providing the proof of work has invested a predefined amount of effort in order to create the proof and secondly, that the proof is efficiently verifiable.
    <br>Typically, finding a solution to a proof of work puzzle is a probabilistic process with a success probability depending on the predefined difficulty.

    <br>Proof_of_Work_(PoW):
    <br><strong>A number</strong> that is provably hard to compute.
    <br>That is, it takes measurable amount of time and/or computational power (energy) to produce.
    <br>In Bitcoin it is <a class="clsPreview" href="#idBtchsh256">a hash</a> of <a class="clsPreview" href="#idBtcblkhdr">a block header</a>.
    <br>A block is considered valid only if its hash is lower than the current *target* (roughly, starts with a certain amount of zero bits). Each block refers to a previous  block thus accumulating previous proof-of-work and forming a *blockchain*.
    <br>
    <br>Proof-of-work is not the only requirement, but an important one to make sure that it is economically infeasible to produce an alternative history of transactions with the same accumulated work. Each client can independently consider the most difficult chain of valid blocks as the "true" history of transactions, without need to trust any source that provides the blocks.
    <br>
    <br>Note that owning a very large amount of computational power does not override other rules enforced by every client. Ill-formed blocks or blocks containing invalid transactions are rejected no matter how difficult they were to produce.

    <br>A proof of work is a piece of data which was difficult (costly, time-consuming) to produce so as to satisfy certain requirements. It must be trivial to check whether data satisfies said requirements. Producing a proof of work can be a random process with low probability, so that a lot of trial and error is required on average before a valid proof of work is generated. Bitcoin uses the Hashcash proof of work.
    <br>
    <br>One application of this idea is using hashcash as a method to preventing email spam, requiring a proof of work on the email's contents (including the To address), on every email. Legitimate emails will be able to do the work to generate the proof easily (not much work is required for a single email), but mass spam emailers will have difficulty generating the required proofs (which would require huge computational resources).
    <br>
    <br>Hashcash proofs of work are used in Bitcoin for block generation. Proofs of work that are tied to the data of each block are required for the blocks to be accepted. The difficulty of this work is adjusted so as to limit the rate at which new blocks can be generated by the network to one every 10 minutes. Due to the very low probability of successful generation, this makes it unpredictable which worker computer in the network will be able to generate the next block.
    <br>
    <br>For a block to be valid it must hash to a value less than the current target; this means that each block indicates that work has been done generating it. Each block contains the hash of the preceding block, thus each block has a chain of blocks that together contain a large amount of work. Changing a block (which can only be done by making a new block containing the same predecessor) requires regenerating all successors and redoing the work they contain. This protects the block chain from tampering.
    <br>
    <br>The most widely used proof-of-work scheme is SHA-256, which was introduced by Bitcoin. Some other hashing algorithms that are used for proof-of-work include scrypt, Blake-256, CryptoNight,[1] HEFTY1, Quark, SHA-3, scrypt-jane, scrypt-n, and combinations.

    <br>Using a separate address for each incoming payment makes it trivial to determine which customers have paid their payment requests.
    <br>Your applications need only track the association between a particular payment request and the address used in it, and then scan the block chain for transactions matching that address.

    <br>Avoiding Key Reuse
    <br>In a transaction, the spender and receiver each reveal to each other all public keys or addresses used in the transaction. This allows either person to use the public block chain to track past and future transactions involving the other person’s same public keys or addresses.
    <br>
    <br>If the same public key is reused often, as happens when people use Bitcoin addresses (hashed public keys) as static payment addresses, other people can easily track the receiving and spending habits of that person, including how many satoshis they control in known addresses.
    <br>
    <br>It doesn’t have to be that way.
    <br><strong>If each public key is used exactly <span class="clsU">twice</span>—once to receive a payment and once to spend that payment—the user can gain a significant amount of financial privacy</strong>.
    <br>
    <br>Even better, using new public keys or unique addresses when accepting payments or creating change outputs can be combined with other techniques discussed later, such as CoinJoin or merge avoidance, to make it extremely difficult to use the block chain by itself to reliably track how users receive and spend their satoshis.
    <br>
    <br>Avoiding key reuse can also provide security against attacks which might allow reconstruction of private keys from public keys (hypothesized) or from signature comparisons (possible today under certain circumstances described below, with more general attacks hypothesized).
    <br>
    <br>Unique (non-reused) P2PKH and P2SH addresses protect against the first type of attack by keeping ECDSA public keys hidden (hashed) until the first time satoshis sent to those addresses are spent, so attacks are effectively useless unless they can reconstruct private keys in less than the hour or two it takes for a transaction to be well protected by the block chain.
    <br>
    <br>Unique (non-reused) private keys protect against the second type of attack by only generating one signature per private key, so attackers never get a subsequent signature to use in comparison-based attacks. Existing comparison-based attacks are only practical today when insufficient entropy is used in signing or when the entropy used is exposed by some means, such as a side-channel attack.
    <br>
    <br>So, for both privacy and security, we encourage you to build your applications to avoid public key reuse and, when possible, to discourage users from reusing addresses. If your application needs to provide a fixed URI to which payments should be sent, please see the bitcoin: URI section below.

    <br>How do bitcoin transactions work?
    <br>Jan 9th 2015, 15:03 BY THE DATA TEAM
    <br>
    <br>Even Satoshi Nakamoto, the elusive creator of bitcoin, admitted that his invention is hard to explain–because there is nothing you can compare it to. Here is how a bitcoin transaction is processed:
    <br>
    <br>1) Payers initiate a bitcoin payment using "wallet" software.
    <br>
    <br>2) This and other pending transactions are broadcast on the global bitcoin network.
    <br>
    <br>3) Once every ten minutes or so, "miners", specialised computers (or groups of computers) on this network, collect a few hundred transactions and combine them in a "block".
    <br>
    <br>4) In order to mine a block and validate the transaction, miners compete to solve a difficult mathematical equation (a "hash function"). The miner that solves the equation first further processes the block and broadcasts this "proof-of-work" to the bitcoin network.
    <br>
    <br>5) The other miners check the proof-of-work and the validity of the transactions. If they approve, the winning miner gets a reward of 25 newly minted bitcoin (about $6,900 at current prices), which is the incentive for miners to provide computing power. Adjusting the difficulty of the puzzle ensures that the supply of new bitcoins remains steady.
    <br>
    <br>6) The mined block is added to the "blockchain", a big, unbreakable ledger that lives on the bitcoin network and serves as a record of all transactions.
    <br>
    <br>7) The payee can use his wallet software to see whether the bitcoin have arrived.

    <br>===
    <br>Each transaction is prefixed by <strong>a four-byte transaction version number</strong> which tells Bitcoin peers and miners which set of rules to use to validate it. This lets developers create new rules for future transactions without invalidating previous transactions.
    <br>===
    <br>Transaction version numbers will be a better way to specify exactly what rues should be used to validate a transaction; transactions with old version numbers will be validated under the old rules, transactions with new version numbers will always be validated under the new rules before being relayed or included in mined blocks. To avoid being in the minority fork of a block chain split, transactions with new version numbers appearing in blocks will only be validated using the new rules when a super-majority of the network (as expressed by block version numbers in the last N blocks) supports the new feature.
    <br>
    <br>A transaction's version number is part of it's hash (transaction ID) and is part of the signature hash, so cannot be changed by an attacker. However, software using new transaction features will need to make sure that transactions have the correct version number before asking users to provide signatures or telling users that the transaction has been properly signed, etc.

    <br>===
    <br>Coinbase:
    <br>An input script of a transaction that generates new bitcoins. Or a name of that transaction itself ("coinbase transaction"). Coinbase transaction does not spend any existing transactions, but contains exactly one input which may contain any data in its script. *Genesis block* transaction contains a reference to The Times article from January 3rd 2009 to prove that more blocks were not created before that date. Some *mining pools* put their names in the coinbase transactions (so everyone can estimate how much *hashrate* each pool produces).
    <br>
    <br>Coinbase is also used to vote on a protocol change (e.g. *P2SH*). Miners vote by putting some agreed-upon marker in the coinbase to see how many support the change. If a majority of miners support it and expect non-mining users to accept it, then they simply start enforcing new rule. Minority then should either continue with a forked blockchain (thus producing an *altcoin*) or accept new rule.

    <br>SINGLE clears all output scripts but the one with the same index as the input in question.
    <br>NONE clears all outputs thus allowing changing them at will.

    <br>Change:
    <br>Informal name for a portion of a *transaction output* that <strong>is returned to a sender</strong> as a "change" after spending that output.
    <br>Since *transaction outputs* cannot be partially spent, one can spend 1 BTC out of 3 BTC output only be creating two new outputs: a "payment" output with 1 BTC sent to a payee address, and a "change" output with remaining 2 BTC (minus *transaction fees*) sent to the payer's addresses.
    <br>*BitcoinQT* always uses new address from a *key pool* for a better privacy.
    <br>*Blockchain.info* sends to a default address in the wallet.
    <br>
    <br>A common mistake when working with a *paper wallet* or a *brain wallet* is to make a change transaction to a different address and then accidentally delete it.
    <br>E.g. when importing a private key in a temporary BitcoinQT wallet, making a transaction and then deleting the temporary wallet.

    <br>One thing all signature hash types sign is the transaction’s locktime. (Called nLockTime in the Bitcoin Core source code.) The locktime indicates the earliest time a transaction can be added to the block chain.
    <br>
    <br>Locktime allows signers to create time-locked transactions which will only become valid in the future, giving the signers a chance to change their minds.
    <br>
    <br>If any of the signers change their mind, they can create a new non-locktime transaction. The new transaction will use, as one of its inputs, one of the same outputs which was used as an input to the locktime transaction. This makes the locktime transaction invalid if the new transaction is added to the block chain before the time lock expires.

  <p id="idBtctxfeedsn">description::
    <br>Fees are relatively unimportant at the moment since “miners” who successfully process a block of transactions are rewarded with newly created bitcoin. However, fees will become more important in the future because the amount of new bitcoin issued to a successful miner is cut in half roughly every four years. If increasing the block size lowers the transaction fees miners can expect to receive, one would expect fewer miners competing to process transactions as the block reward decreases over time. The bitcoin system would become more centralized as a result.

    <br>===
    <br>Transaction_Fee:
    <br>Also known as "miners' fee", an amount that an author of transaction pays to a miner who will include the transaction in a block.
    <br>The fee is expressed as difference between the sum of all *input* amounts and a sum of all *output* amounts.
    <br>Unlike traditional payment systems, miners do not explicitly require fees and most miners allow free transactions.
    <br>All miners are competing between each other for the fees and all transactions are competing for a place in a block.
    <br>There are soft rules encoded in most clients that define minimum fees per kilobyte to relay or mine a transaction (mostly to prevent *DoS* and *spam*).
    <br>Typically, the fee affects the priority of a transaction.
    <br>As of July 27, 2014 average fee per block is below 0.1 BTC.
    <br>See also *Reward*.

    <br>===
    <br>The amount remaining when the value of all outputs in a transaction are subtracted from all inputs in a transaction; the fee is paid to the miner who includes that transaction in a block.
    <br>[<a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/glossary/transaction-fee">https://bitcoin.org/en/glossary/transaction-fee</a>]
    <br>===
    <br>A small fee imposed on some transactions sent across the bitcoin network.
    <br>The transaction fee is awarded to the miner that successfully hashes the block containing the relevant transaction.
    <br>[<a href="http://www.coindesk.com/information/bitcoin-glossary/">http://www.coindesk.com/information/bitcoin-glossary</a>/]
    <br>===
    <br>Transaction fees may be included with any transfer of bitcoins from one address to another. At the moment, many transactions are typically processed in a way where no fee is expected at all, but for transactions which draw coins from many bitcoin addresses and therefore have a large data size, a small transaction fee is usually expected.
    <br>
    <br>The transaction fee is processed by and received by the bitcoin miner. When a new bitcoin block is generated with a successful hash, the information for all of the transactions is included with the block and all transaction fees are collected by that user creating the block, who is free to assign those fees to himself.
    <br>
    <br>Transaction fees are voluntary on the part of the person making the bitcoin transaction, as the person attempting to make a transaction can include any fee or none at all in the transaction. On the other hand, nobody mining new bitcoins necessarily needs to accept the transactions and include them in the new block being created. The transaction fee is therefore an incentive on the part of the bitcoin user to make sure that a particular transaction will get included into the next block which is generated.
    <br>
    <br>It is envisioned that over time the cumulative effect of collecting transaction fees will allow somebody creating new blocks to "earn" more bitcoins than will be mined from new bitcoins created by the new block itself. This is also an incentive to keep trying to create new blocks even if the value of the newly created block from the mining activity is zero in the far future.

    <br>Bitcoin uses <strong>a scripting system</strong> for transactions.
    <br>Forth-like, Script is simple, stack-based, and processed from left to right.
    <br>It is purposefully not Turing-complete, with no loops.
    <br>[<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script</a>]
    <br>===
    <br>The script language is a Forth-like stack-based language deliberately designed to be stateless and not Turing complete.
    <br>Statelessness ensures that once a transaction is added to the block chain, there is no condition which renders it permanently unspendable.
    <br>Turing-incompleteness (specifically, a lack of loops or gotos) makes the script language less flexible and more predictable, greatly simplifying the security model.

    <br>Although P2SH multisig is now generally used for multisig transactions, this base script can be used to require multiple signatures before a UTXO can be spent.
    <br>
    <br>In multisig pubkey scripts, called m-of-n, m is the minimum number of signatures which must match a public key; n is the number of public keys being provided. Both m and n should be opcodes OP_1 through OP_16, corresponding to the number desired.
    <br>
    <br>Because of an off-by-one error in the original Bitcoin implementation which must be preserved for compatibility, OP_CHECKMULTISIG consumes one more value from the stack than indicated by m, so the list of secp256k1 signatures in the signature script must be prefaced with an extra value (OP_0) which will be consumed but not used.
    <br>
    <br>The signature script must provide signatures in the same order as the corresponding public keys appear in the pubkey script or redeem script. See the description in OP_CHECKMULTISIG for details.

    <br>Null Data
    <br>Null data transaction type relayed and mined by default in Bitcoin Core 0.9.0 and later that adds arbitrary data to a provably unspendable pubkey script that full nodes don’t have to store in their UTXO database. It is preferable to use null data transactions over transactions that bloat the UTXO database because they cannot be automatically pruned; however, it is usually even more preferable to store data outside transactions if possible.
    <br>
    <br>Consensus rules allow null data outputs up to the maximum allowed pubkey script size of 10,000 bytes provided they follow all other consensus rules, such as not having any data pushes larger than 520 bytes.
    <br>
    <br>Bitcoin Core 0.9.x to 0.10.x will, by default, relay and mine null data transactions with up to 40 bytes in a single data push and only one null data output that pays exactly 0 satoshis:
    <br>
    <br>Pubkey Script: OP_RETURN &lt;0 to 40 bytes of data>
    <br>(Null data scripts cannot be spent, so there's no signature script.)
    <br>Bitcoin Core 0.11.x increases this default to 80 bytes, with the other rules remaining the same.
    <br>
    <br>Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 defaults to relaying and mining null data outputs with up to 83 bytes with any number of data pushes, provided the total byte limit is not exceeded. There must still only be a single null data output and it must still pay exactly 0 satoshis.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcstlevlnH4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idBtcstlevlndsn">description::
    <br>However, the scripting language as implemented in Bitcoin has several important limitations:
    <br>
    <br><strong>Lack of Turing-completeness</strong> - that is to say, while there is a large subset of computation that the Bitcoin scripting language supports, it does not nearly support everything. The main category that is missing is loops. This is done to avoid infinite loops during transaction verification; theoretically it is a surmountable obstacle for script programmers, since any loop can be simulated by simply repeating the underlying code many times with an if statement, but it does lead to scripts that are very space-inefficient. For example, implementing an alternative elliptic curve signature algorithm would likely require 256 repeated multiplication rounds all individually included in the code.
    <br><strong>Value-blindness</strong> -
    <br>there is no way for a UTXO script to provide fine-grained control over the amount that can be withdrawn.
    <br>For example, one powerful use case of an oracle contract would be a hedging contract, where A and B put in $1000 worth of BTC and after 30 days the script sends $1000 worth of BTC to A and the rest to B.
    <br>This would require an oracle to determine the value of 1 BTC in USD, but even then it is a massive improvement in terms of trust and infrastructure requirement over the fully centralized solutions that are available now.
    <br>However, because UTXO are all-or-nothing, the only way to achieve this is through the very inefficient hack of having many UTXO of varying denominations (eg. one UTXO of 2k for every k up to 30) and having O pick which UTXO to send to A and which to B.
    <br><strong>Lack of state</strong> -
    <br>UTXO can either be spent or unspent; there is no opportunity for multi-stage contracts or scripts which keep any other internal state beyond that.
    <br>This makes it hard to make multi-stage options contracts, decentralized exchange offers or two-stage cryptographic commitment protocols (necessary for secure computational bounties).
    <br>It also means that UTXO can only be used to build simple, one-off contracts and not more complex "stateful" contracts such as decentralized organizations, and makes meta-protocols difficult to implement.
    <br>Binary state combined with value-blindness also mean that another important application, withdrawal limits, is impossible.
    <br><strong>Blockchain-blindness</strong> -
    <br>UTXO are blind to certain blockchain data such as the nonce and previous block hash.
    <br>This severely limits applications in gambling, and several other categories, by depriving the scripting language of a potentially valuable source of randomness.

  <p id="idBtcstlextnP1">DOING:
    <br>1. CODE: &lt;Sig>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; STACK: &lt;Sig>
    <br>The signature (from Bob’s signature script) is added (pushed) to an empty stack. Because it’s just data, nothing is done except adding it to the stack.
    <br>2. CODE: &lt;PubKey>&nbsp; &nbsp; STACK: &lt;PubKey>&lt;Sig>
    <br>The public key (also from the signature script) is pushed on top of the signature.
    <br>3. CODE: OP_DUP&nbsp; &nbsp; STACK: &lt;PubKey>&lt;PubKey>&lt;Sig>
    <br>From Alice’s pubkey script, the OP_DUP operation is executed. OP_DUP pushes onto the stack a copy of the data currently at the top of it—in this case creating a copy of the public key Bob provided.
    <br>4. CODE: OP_HASH160&nbsp; &nbsp; STACK: &lt;PubKeyHash>&lt;PubKey>&lt;Sig>
    <br>The operation executed next, OP_HASH160, pushes onto the stack a hash of the data currently on top of it—in this case, Bob’s public key. This creates a hash of Bob’s public key.
    <br>5. CODE: &lt;PubKeyHash>&nbsp; &nbsp; STACK: &lt;PubKeyHash>&lt;PubKeyHash>&lt;PubKey>&lt;Sig>
    <br>Alice’s pubkey script then pushes the pubkey hash that Bob gave her for the first transaction. At this point, there should be two copies of Bob’s pubkey hash at the top of the stack.
    <br>6. CODE: OP_EQUALVERIFY&nbsp; &nbsp; STACK: &lt;PubKey>&lt;Sig>
    <br>Now it gets interesting: Alice’s pubkey script executes OP_EQUALVERIFY.
    <br>OP_EQUALVERIFY is equivalent to executing OP_EQUAL followed by OP_VERIFY (not shown).
    <br>OP_EQUAL (not shown) checks the two values at the top of the stack; in this case, it checks whether the pubkey hash generated from the full public key Bob provided equals the pubkey hash Alice provided when she created transaction #1.
    <br>OP_EQUAL pops (removes from the top of the stack) the two values it compared, and replaces them with the result of that comparison: zero (false) or one (true).
    <br>OP_VERIFY (not shown) checks the value at the top of the stack.
    <br>If the value is false it immediately terminates evaluation and the transaction validation fails.
    <br>Otherwise it pops the true value off the stack.
    <br>7. CODE: OP_CHECKSIG&nbsp; &nbsp; STACK: true
    <br>Finally, Alice’s pubkey script executes OP_CHECKSIG, which checks the signature Bob provided against the now-authenticated public key he also provided.
    <br>If the signature matches the public key and was generated using all of the data required to be signed, OP_CHECKSIG pushes the value true onto the top of the stack.
    <br>If false is not at the top of the stack after the pubkey script has been evaluated, the transaction is valid (provided there are no other problems with it).

    <br>Confirmation means that <strong>a transaction has been processed by the network</strong> and is highly unlikely to be reversed.
    <br>Transactions receive a confirmation when they are included in a block and for each subsequent block.
    <br>Even a single confirmation can be considered secure for low value transactions, although for larger amounts like 1000 US$, it makes sense to wait for 6 confirmations or more.
    <br>Each confirmation exponentially decreases the risk of a reversed transaction.

    <br>===
    <br>Unconfirmed transactions aren't secure
    <br>Transactions don't start out as irreversible. Instead, they get a confirmation score that indicates how hard it is to reverse them (see table). Each confirmation takes between a few seconds and 90 minutes, with 10 minutes being the average. If the transaction pays too low a fee or is otherwise atypical, getting the first confirmation can take much longer.

    <br>Confirmation:
    <br>The act of hashing a bitcoin transaction successfully into a transaction block, and cementing its validity.
    <br>A single confirmation will take around 10 minutes, which is the average length of time for a transaction block to be hashed.
    <br>However, some more sensitive or larger transactions may require multiple confirmations, meaning that more blocks must be hashed and added to the blockchain after the transaction’s block has been hashed.
    <br>Each time another block is added to the blockchain after the transaction’s block, the transaction is confirmed again.

Quite impressive, but let’s be honest. While there are many other wallets out there, given that Blockchain is the most popular wallet maker, bitcoin transaction volume is very far behind Visa. Reason of this lies in the fact that bitcoin transactions have been too cumbersome. So I’m convinced projects like Thunder are part of the solution.

  <p id="idBtctxCnbNodsn">description::
    <br>In principle, there are two types of transactions, coinbase transactions and regular transactions.
    <br>Coinbase transactions are special transactions in which new Bitcoins are introduced into the system.
    <br>They are included in every block as the very first transaction and are meant as a reward for solving a proof of work puzzle.
    <br>Regular transactions, on the other hand, are used to transfer existing Bitcoins amongst different users.
    <br>From an architectural point of view, a coinbase transaction can be seen as a special case of a regular transaction.
    <br>For this reason, the structure of a regular transaction will be discussed first, followed by the differences between coinbase and regular transactions.

    <br>After the discovery of several dangerous bugs in early versions of Bitcoin, a test was added which only accepted transactions from the network if their pubkey scripts and signature scripts matched a small set of believed-to-be-safe templates, and if the rest of the transaction didn’t violate another small set of rules enforcing good network behavior.
    <br>This is the IsStandard() test, and transactions which pass it are called <span class="clsColorRed">standard transactions</span>.
    <br>[<a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-guide#standard-transactions">https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-guide#standard-transactions</a>]
    <br>===
    <br>As of Bitcoin Core 0.9.3, standard transactions must also meet the following conditions:
    <br>
    <br>The transaction must be finalized: either its locktime must be in the past (or less than or equal to the current block height), or all of its sequence numbers must be 0xffffffff.
    <br>
    <br>The transaction must be smaller than 100,000 bytes. That’s around 200 times larger than a typical single-input, single-output P2PKH transaction.
    <br>
    <br>Each of the transaction’s signature scripts must be smaller than 1,650 bytes. That’s large enough to allow 15-of-15 multisig transactions in P2SH using compressed public keys.
    <br>
    <br>Bare (non-P2SH) multisig transactions which require more than 3 public keys are currently non-standard.
    <br>
    <br>The transaction’s signature script must only push data to the script evaluation stack. It cannot push new opcodes, with the exception of opcodes which solely push data to the stack.
    <br>
    <br>The transaction must not include any outputs which receive fewer than 1/3 as many satoshis as it would take to spend it in a typical input. That’s currently 546 satoshis for a P2PKH or P2SH output on a Bitcoin Core node with the default relay fee. Exception: standard null data outputs must receive zero satoshis.

    <br>===
    <br>Some transactions are considered *standard*, meaning they are relayed and mined by most *nodes*.
    <br>More complex transactions could be buggy or cause DoS attacks on the network, so they are considered *non-standard* and not relayed or mined by most nodes.
    <br>Both standard and non-standard transactions are valid and once included in the blockchain, will be recognized by all nodes.
    <br>Standard transactions are:
    <br>1) sending to a *public key*,
    <br>2) sending to an *address*,

    <br>As of July 27, 2014 the hash rate of all Bitcoin mining nodes combined is around 135 799 000 GH/s.
    <br>For comparison, AMD Radeon graphics cards produce from 0.2 to 0.8 GH/s depending on model.

    <br>Hash (Rate) ~ A hash is the output of a hash function and, as it relates to Bitcoin, the Hash Rate is the speed at which a compute is completing an operation in the Bitcoin code.
    <br>A higher hash rate is better when mining as it increases your <strong>opportunity of finding the next block</strong> and receiving the reward.

  <p id="idBtchhrtrscP1">Bitcoin’s Network Hash Rate Has Doubled Since October
    <br>Jan 23, 20174:20 PM EST by Kyle Torpey
    <br>
    <br>Bitcoin’s mining difficulty increased by 16.6 percent over the weekend, signaling that the network’s overall hash rate has also increased by a similar amount over the past two weeks. The network’s total estimated hash rate has essentially doubled since the middle of October. A large chunk of this increase has taken place over the past month, where the hash rate has increased by more than 50 percent.
    <br>
    <br>The network hash rate is the total amount of computing power pointed at the Bitcoin network.
    <br>
    <br>Pools That Saw Their Share of Total Hashing Power Increase
    <br>
    <br>It’s difficult to know where exactly this new hashing power is being deployed, but it is possible to see the differences in mining pools’ shares of the overall hash rate.
    <br>
    <br>When comparing the most recently completed difficulty period with a run of 2016 blocks from the middle of October, GBMiners is the pool that saw the largest amount of growth. GBMiners enjoyed an increase of 62 blocks compared to the total set of 2016 blocks from October. Recently, it was found that GBMiners is connected to a Ponzi scheme disguised as a bitcoin cloud mining operation in India.
    <br>
    <br>Since October, BTC.TOP has grown from nothing to roughly 3 percent of the network hash rate. Batpool also emerged during this period of time to grab a little over 1 percent of the network. Not much is known about either of these China-based pools, other than the fact that ltc1btc.com Founder and CEO Jiang Zhuo’er is behind BTC.TOP and does not much care for Bitcoin Core’s Segregated Witness improvement.
    <br>
    <br>Both GBMiners and BTC.TOP signal support for Bitcoin Unlimited as opposed to Bitcoin Core. Bitcoin Unlimited is software that intends to replace Bitcoin’s 1 MB block size limit with the concept of emergent consensus. At this time, it is unclear if this new digital currency network would be a new version of Bitcoin or an altcoin.
    <br>
    <br>In terms of pools signaling for Bitcoin Core’s Segregated Witness improvement, Bitfury saw the largest amount of growth. The mining pool saw an increase of just under 3 percent between the middle of October and the most recently completed difficulty period.
    <br>
    <br>Pools That Saw Their Share of Total Hashing Power Decrease
    <br>
    <br>If the above mining pools are mining more blocks, then that means someone else must be mining fewer blocks.
    <br>
    <br>No miner saw a bigger drop in their share of the network since October than BTCC. BTCC now mines about 35 percent less blocks than they did in October.
    <br>
    <br>No other pool came close to BTCC in terms of a loss in their share of the network hash rate, but ViaBTC and Slush Pool also saw notable declines. These two pools are mining about 25 percent less than the number of blocks they were mining in October.
    <br>
    <br>The two largest mining pools on the network, Antpool and F2Pool, mined roughly 5 percent fewer blocks when their numbers were combined.
    <br>
    <br>Although never the largest pools on the network, Bitcoin.com, GoGreenLight and Kano CKPool all saw sizable declines.
    <br>
    <br>Hash Rate Continuing to Increase
    <br>
    <br>Although the last difficulty period saw a rather massive increase of 16.6 percent, it appears that hash rate is continuing to be added to the network. At 118 blocks into the current difficulty period, there has already been another estimated 15.25 percent increase in the network hash rate.
    <br>
    <br>Judging from the rapidly increasing hash rate, it appears multiple mining pools are receiving shipments of new hardware. While some predicted Bitcoin could crash and burn as a result of the halving event over the summer, the mining pools were correct in predicting a more positive outcome.
    <br>
    <br>As Bitcoin’s total hash rate increases, it becomes more difficult for a motivated adversary to pull off an effective attack on the network.

    <br>Bitcoin is one such cryptocurrency that utilizes the SHA-256d hashing algorithm.

    <br>Elliptic_Curve_Arithmetic:

    <br>Bitcoin protocol uses predefined curve <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1">secp256k1</a>.
    <br>Here's the simplest possible explanation of the operations: you can add and subtract points and multiply them by an integer.
    <br>Dividing by an integer is computationally infeasible (otherwise cryptographic signatures won't work).
    <br>The private key is a 256-bit integer and the public key is a product of a predefined point G ("generator") by that integer: A = G * a.
    <br>Associativity law allows implementing interesting cryptographic schemes like Diffie-Hellman key exchange (ECDH): two parties with private keys *a* and *b* may exchange their public keys *A* and *B* to compute a shared secret point C: C = A * b = B * a because (G * a) * b == (G * b) * a.
    <br>Then this point C can be used as an AES encryption key to protect their communication channel.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcdngFrkH2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idBtcdngFrkdsn">description::
    <br>The creation of <strong>an alternative ongoing version of the blockchain</strong>, typically because one set of miners begins hashing a different set of transaction blocks from another.
    <br>It can be caused maliciously, by a group of miners gaining too much control over the network (see 51% attack), accidentally, thanks to a bug in the system, or intentionally, when a core development team decides to introduce substantial new features into a new version of a client.
    <br>A fork is successful if it becomes the longest version of the blockchain, as defined by difficulty.
    <br>[<a href="http://www.coindesk.com/information/bitcoin-glossary/">http://www.coindesk.com/information/bitcoin-glossary</a>/]
    <br>===
    <br>Fork:
    <br>Refers either to
    <br>- a fork of a source code (see *Altcoin*) or,
    <br>- more often, to a split of the blockchain when two different parts of the network see different *main chains*.
    <br>In a sense, fork occurs every time two blocks of the same *height* are created at the same time.
    <br>Both blocks always have the different hashes (and therefore different *difficulty*), so when a node sees both of them, it will always choose the most difficult one.
    <br>However, before both blocks arrive to a majority of nodes, two parts of the network will see different blocks as tips of the main chain.
    <br>
    <br>Term *fork* or *hard fork* also refers to a change of the protocol that may lead to a split of the network (by design or because of a bug).
    <br>On March 11 2013 a smaller half of the network running version 0.7 of *bitcoind* could not include a large (>900 Kb) block at height 225430 created by a miner running newer version 0.8.
    <br>The block could not be included because of the bug in v0.7 which was fixed in v0.8.
    <br>Since the majority of computing power did not have a problem, it continued to build a chain on top of a problematic block.
    <br>When the issue was noticed, majority of 0.8 miners agreed to abandon 24 blocks incompatible with 0.7 miners and mine on top of 0.7 chain.
    <br>Except for one double spend experiment against OKPay, all transactions during the fork were properly included in both sides of the blockchain.

    <br>Bitcoin is one of the first implementations of a concept called crypto-currency, which was first described in 1998 by Wei Dai on the cypherpunks mailing list. Building upon the notion that money is any object, or any sort of record, <strong>accepted as payment</strong> for goods and services and repayment of debts in a given country or socio-economic context, Bitcoin is designed around the idea of using cryptography to control the creation and transfer of money, rather than relying on central authorities.

    <br>Bitcoin is a new invention created to serve the market demand for a better medium of exchange.
    <br>It derives a great portion of its value from governmental restrictions on voluntary exchange.
    <br>As long as governments interfere with individual voluntary exchange there will be demand for inventions like bitcoin.
    <br>In the event of the disappearance of governments, bitcoin (or something similar) is likely to continue as a desired medium of exchange because it makes it difficult, if not impossible, for new governments to gain control of the monetary system.

    <br>Επεσε κατά 120 δολάρια η τιμή του Bitcoin μέσα σε μια εβδομάδα
    <br>Πτώση 120 δολαρίων κατέγραψε η τιμή του Bitcoin μέσα σε μια εβδομάδα με τους αναλυτές να αναμένουν πως η τιμή του ψηφιακού νομίσματος θα μειωθεί περαιτέρω, καθώς γίνεται διαρκώς όλο και λιγότερο ευαίσθητο στα «καλά νέα».
    <br>
    <br>Συγκεκριμένα, σύμφωνα με την πλατφόρμα CoinDesk η αξία διαπραγμάτευσης του Bitcoin υποχώρησε σήμερα Τρίτη στα 451 δολάρια από 571 δολάρια πριν από μία εβδομάδα, ενώ χθες βρέθηκε να διαπραγματεύεται ακόμη και στα 309 δολάρια στη βουλγαρική πλατφόρμα συναλλαγών Bitcoin BTC-e.
    <br>
    <br>Οι ειδικοί αποδίδουν τις απώλειες του Bitcoin στις προσπάθειες κάποιων traders να καλύψουν τις θέσεις τους, πιέζοντας περαιτέρω τις τιμές. Σε κάθε περίπτωση η πτώση της τιμής του ψηφιακού νομίσματος συνδέεται και με την μεγαλύτερη εποπτεία που έχει υπάρξει στις πλατφόρμες διαπραγμάτευσης του.
    <br>
    <br>Με δεδομένο ότι τα εικονικά νομίσματα βρέθηκαν στο προσκήνιο της δημοσιότητας τον προηγούμενο Φεβρουάριο λόγω της κατάρρευσης κάποιων πλατφόρμων διαπραγμάτευσης οι κεντρικές τράπεζες διεθνώς απεύθυναν συστάσεις στους επενδυτές – καταναλωτές για τους πιθανούς κινδύνους. Το ίδιο έπραξε και η  Τράπεζα της Ελλάδος υιοθετώντας σχετικές επισημάνσεις της Ευρωπαϊκής Αρχής Τραπεζών.

    <br>By Naomi Ng for CNN
    <br>January 7, 2014 -- Updated 0305 GMT (1105 HKT)
    <br>This file photo shows users waiting in line to use the world's first real Bitcoin ATM in Vancouver, Canada on October 29, 2013.
    <br>Hong Kong (CNN) -- The world's second Bitcoin ATM is due to land in Hong Kong by the end of this month, according to U.S. based software company Robocoin.
    <br>The machine, available for sale to individual operators such as banks and private entrepreneurs, allows users to buy or sell Bitcoin in just a few minutes.
    <br>The process should be much faster than setting up an account on an exchange or via mobile apps and computers which could take a few days for account verification.
    <br>The advent of Bitcoin ATMs is seen as a step towards bringing the digital currency into the real world.
    <br>"It removes all the pain and barriers of entry to buying Bitcoin on an online exchange," said Robocoin chief executive Jordan Kelley.
    <br>"Our goal as a company is to make the acquisition truly grandma friendly," he added.

    <br>The virtual currency has generated lots of media attention in China where investors have helped drive the price up to dramatic highs above $1,000.
    <br>"I think we're going to unleash the power of Bitcoin. It opens a virtual money portal where people can send money to and from," said Kelley.
    <br>This is how it works:
    <br>Customers must choose to either buy or sell Bitcoin.
    <br>Let's say you want to make a withdrawal from your Bitcoin wallet. After choosing an amount of cash you'd like to withdraw, the software installed in the ATM generates a code which you have to scan with your smartphone.
    <br>Simultaneously, the machine also produces a receipt.
    <br>Following a confirmation from the Bitcoin network to your phone, you can then scan the code on the receipt at the kiosk, which then prompts the ATM to spit out the allotted amount of cash.
    <br>The machine is also equipped with a hand scanner that creates a biometric authenticated identity as an anti-money laundering measure.
    <br>Casper Cheng Tsz Chun, a Hong Kong Bitcoin enthusiast, said the ATM would work a bit like a vending machine "for buying and selling virtual goods (Bitcoin) instead of physical goods like a can of soda."

    <br>Robocoin's first Bitcoin ATM launched in Vancouver in October, and after a month of operation, transactions have totaled 1 million Canadian Dollars ($942,000) in total transactions, according to the company.
    <br>Kelley said the company has already sold 50 ATMs to other operators worldwide but they are not yet in operation.
    <br>The company said it chose Hong Kong as the next place to launch its cash machine for the virtual currency because it "responds well to technological innovation."
    <br>Kelley declined to disclose where the ATM would be located.
    <br>I think we're going to unleash the power of Bitcoin
    <br>Jordan Kelley, Robocoin CEO
    <br>Not every government in Asia is ready for a Bitcoin ATM.
    <br>Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) and Central Bank released a joint statement on their website on Monday stating it does not recognize Bitcoin as an accepted form of currency.
    <br>The installation of Robocoin Bitcoin ATMs will be prohibited said Tseng Ming-chung, FSC chairman in an interview with Taiwan's Central News Agency.
    <br>"Bitcoin is not real currency and banks cannot receive or provide it. Installing ATMs require the authorization of the FSC, but it will not be approved, thus it is 'impossible' for Bitcoin ATMs to enter or appear in Taiwan," Central News Agency reported.
    <br>The statement also warned institutions against the risk of investing in Bitcoin because of the extremely volatile price.
    <br>China's central bank issued new rules in December that prohibited financial institutions from dealing in the digital currency. While it did not outlaw individuals from owning Bitcoin, it specifies that it is not to be considered a currency.
    <br>Despite the setback, Robocoin's chief executive said he still firmly believes China will come to accept Bitcoin.
    <br>"Citizens around the world love Bitcoin. The Chinese are very pragmatic in their approach, they just want to make sure they have a very good understanding of the market and the usage," he said.
    <br>Kelley revealed that Robocoin has begun talks with several operators in China that are reaching out to the government and local regulators to "educate" them about the value and potential of the Bitcoin market.

    <br>The act of spending bitcoins twice.
    <br>It happens when someone makes a transaction using bitcoins, and then makes a second purchase from someone else, using the same bitcoins.
    <br>They then convince the rest of the network to confirm only one of the transactions by hashing it in a block.
    <br>Double spending is not easy to do, thanks to the way that the bitcoin network operates, but it is nevertheless a risk run by those accepting zero-confirmation transactions.

    <br>Mixing:
    <br>A process of exchanging coins with other persons in order to increase privacy of one's history.
    <br>Sometimes it is associated with money laundering, but strictly speaking it is orthogonal to laundering.
    <br>In traditional banking, a bank protects customer's privacy by hiding transactions from all 3rd parties.
    <br>In Bitcoin any merchant may do a statistical analysis of one's entire payment history and determine, for instance, how many bitcoins one owns.
    <br>While it's still possible to implement KYC (Know You Customer) rules on a level of every merchant, mixing allows to to separate information about one's history between the merchants.
    <br>
    <br>Most important use cases for mixing are:
    <br>1) receiving a salary as a single big monthly payment and then spending it in small transactions ("cafe sees thousands of dollars when you pay just $4");
    <br>2) making a single payment and revealing connection of many small private spendings ("car dealer sees how much you are addicted to coffee").
    <br>In both cases your employer, a cafe and a car dealer may comply with KYC/AML laws and report your identity and transferred amounts, but neither of them need to know about each other.
    <br>Mixing bitcoins after receiving a salary and mixing them before making a big payment solves this privacy problem.

    <br>The protocol also halves the rate at which new bitcoins are created every four years, and limits the total number of bitcoins that will be created to a fixed total of 21 million coins. The result is that the number of bitcoins in circulation closely follows an easily predictable curve that reaches 21 million by the year 2140. Due to bitcoin’s diminishing rate of issuance, over the long term, the bitcoin currency is deflationary. Furthermore, bitcoin cannot be inflated by "printing" new money above and beyond the expected issuance rate.

    <br>Το πρωτόκολλο επίσης μειώνει στο μισό, κάθε τέσσερα χρόνια, το ρυθμό με τον οποίο τα νέα bitcoin δημιουργούνται, ενώ ταυτόχρονα περιορίζει τον συνολικό αριθμό των bitcoin που θα δημιουργηθούν σε συνολικά 21 εκατομμύρια νομίσματα.
    <br>Το αποτέλεσμα είναι ότι ο αριθμός των bitcoin σε κυκλοφορία ακολουθεί πιστά μια εύκολα προβλέψιμη καμπύλη που φτάνει τα 21 εκατομμύρια μέχρι το έτος 2140.
    <br>Λόγω του φθίνοντος ποσοστού έκδοσης bitcoin, μακροπρόθεσμα, το bitcoin νόμισμα είναι αποπληθωριστικό.
    <br>Επιπλέον, το bitcoin δεν μπορεί να πληθωριστεί από «εκτύπωση» νέου χρήματος πάνω από τον αναμενόμενο ρυθμό έκδοσης.

    <br>Καθώς το bitcoin είναι δομημένο με τις φαντασιώσεις περί χρυσού, το αυτό ισχύει και για την ποσότητά του. O χρυσός πέρα από γυαλιστερός είναι και σχετικά σπάνιος και αυτή η σπανιότητά του, τον κάνει πολύτιμο και άρα επιθυμητό μέσο συναλλαγής και συσσώρευσης της αξίας. Έτσι και το bitcoin λοιπόν έπρεπε να γίνει σπάνιο. Από τον τρόπο που είναι δομημένο το bitcoin, υπάρχει δυνατότητα να παραχθούν μόλις 21 εκ bitcoins. Είναι αυτή η παραγωγή μια first come first serve περίπτωση? Όχι φυσικά. Τα αστέρια που σχεδίασαν τα bitcoins έφτιαξαν μια παραβολική καμπύλη σύμφωνα με την οποία, όσο περισσότερα bitcoins παράγονται, τόσο πιο δύσκολο θα γίνεται να παραχθούν τα επόμενα. Αυτό το κόλπο στην ουσία εγγυάται τη σπανιότητα του νομίσματος.

    <br>Bitcoinj:
    <br>A Java implementation of a full Bitcoin node by Mike Hearn.
    <br>Also includes *SPV* implementation among other features.
    <br>[<a href="https://github.com/oleganza/bitcoin-papers/blob/master/BitcoinGlossary.md">https://github.com/oleganza/bitcoin-papers/blob/master/BitcoinGlossary.md</a>]
    <br>===
    <br>What is bitcoinj?
    <br>bitcoinj is a library for working with the Bitcoin protocol.
    <br>It can maintain a wallet, send/receive transactions without needing a local copy of Bitcoin Core and has many other advanced features. It's implemented in Java but can be used from any JVM compatible language: examples in Python and JavaScript are included.
    <br>It comes with full documentation and many large, well known Bitcoin apps and services are built on it.
    <br>
    <br>Features
    <br>Highly optimised lightweight simplified payment verification (SPV) mode. In this mode, only a small part of the block chain is downloaded, making bitcoinj suitable for usage on constrained devices like smartphones or cheap virtual private servers.
    <br>
    <br>Experimental full verification mode, which does the same verification work as Bitcoin Core. In this mode, the unspent transaction output set (UTXO set) is calculated and, thanks to a PostgreSQL store, can be indexed into a database allowing for fast lookup of balance by address.
    <br>
    <br>A wallet class with encryption, fee calculation, multi-signing, deterministic key derivation, pluggable coin selection/coin control, extensions support and event listeners that let you stay up to date with changes in your balance.
    <br>
    <br>Support for micropayment channels that let you set up a multi-signature contract between client and server, and then negotiate on the channel, allowing fast micropayments that avoid miner fees.
    <br>
    <br>Provides both async and thread-per-connection for network IO, allowing you to choose between scalability and blocking-only features like SOCKS/Tor proxying.
    <br>
    <br>Easily implement apps that use Bitcoin's contracts features.
    <br>
    <br>A simple GUI wallet app that you can use as the basis for your own apps. Watch or read a tutorial on how to customise it and build a native installer that does not require Java.
    <br>
    <br>Command line tools for working with wallet and chain files, the payment protocol, the network and more.
    <br>
    <br>Strong Bitcoin standards support.
    <br>
    <br>A friendly and helpful community!

    <br>This gets us pretty far, but Bitcoin-style light clients do have their limitations. One particular limitation is that, while they can prove the inclusion of transactions, they cannot prove anything about the current state (eg. digital asset holdings, name registrations, the status of financial contracts, etc). How many bitcoins do you have right now? A Bitcoin light client can use a protocol involving querying multiple nodes and trusting that at least one of them will notify you of any particular transaction spending from your addresses, and this will get you quite far for that use case, but for other more complex applications it isn’t nearly enough; the precise nature of the effect of a transaction can depend on the effect of several previous transactions, which themselves depend on previous transactions, and so ultimately you would have to authenticate every single transaction in the entire chain.

    <br>A scheme to validate transactions without storing the whole blockchain (only block headers) and without trusting any external service.
    <br>Every transaction must be present with all its parent and sibling hashes in a *merkle tree* up to the root.
    <br>SPV client trusts the most *difficult* chain of block headers and can validate if the transaction indeed belongs to a certain block header.
    <br>Since SPV does not validate all transactions, a *51% attack* may not only cause a *double spend* (like with *full nodes*), but also make a completely invalid payment with bitcoins created from nowhere.
    <br>However, this kind of attack is very costly and probably more expensive than a product in question.
    <br>*Bitcoinj* library implements SPV functionality.

    <br>Bitcoin XT is a fork of Bitcoin Core, the reference client for the bitcoin network. In mid-2015, the concept achieved significant attention within the bitcoin community amid a contentious debate among core developers over increasing the blockchain size cap.[1] The current reference implementation for bitcoin contains a computational bottleneck.[2][3] This averages to a daily maximum of around 300,000 transactions.[4]
    <br>It was proposed that the block chain size increase to eight megabyte, i.e. and from then onwards to automatically increase it exponentially, doubling every two years. The proposal did not gain the necessary support to go into effect on the Bitcoin network by early 2016, the earliest possible switchover date. Its use has been in steady decline from March 2016 onwards.

    <br>The approach taken by Hearn and Andresen clearly indicates their commitment to a decentralized system
    <br>
    <br>Fears over excessive centralization are warranted. After all, decentralization is a big part of bitcoin’s value proposition. But the amount of centralization being considered at the moment still seems vastly more decentralized than traditional payment systems.
    <br>
    <br>Indeed, the approach taken by Hearn and Andresen clearly indicates their commitment to a decentralized system. BitcoinXT will continue to enforce the existing blocksize limit until the protocol is so widely adopted that it is used to process at least 75% of all blocks added to the blockchain. If (and only if) that occurs—but no earlier than January—<strong>BitcoinXT will increase the limit to eight megabytes and double that limit every two years thereafter</strong>.
    <br>
    <br>The commitment to gradual change based on consensus observed with the issuance of BitcoinXT is incredible, but perhaps not surprising. It reflects the core values held by bitcoin supporters. And it is also a hallmark of well-functioning <strong>self-governing systems</strong>. It bodes well for bitcoin’s future.

    <br><strong>Bitcoin implementation</strong> based on original code by *Satoshi Nakamoto*.
    <br>Includes a graphical interface for Windows, OS X and Linux (using QT) and a command-line executable *bitcoind* that is typically used on servers.
    <br>It is considered a *reference implementation* as it's <span class="clsBU">the most used *full node* implementation</span>, especially among *miners*.
    <br>Other implementations must be bug-for-bug compatible with it to avoid being *forked*. BitcoinQT uses OpenSSL for its ECDSA operations which has its own quirks that became a part of the standard (e.g. non-canonically encoded public keys are accepted by OpenSSL without an error, so other implementations must do the same).

    <br>Note: hex representation uses <strong>two characters to display each byte of data</strong>, which is why the reversed string looks somewhat mangled.
    <br>The rational for the reversal is unknown, but it likely stems from Bitcoin’s use of hash digests (which are byte arrays in C++) as integers for the purpose of determining whether the hash is below the network target. Whatever the reason for reversing header hashes, the reversal also extends to other hashes used in RPCs, such as TXIDs and merkle roots.
    <br>Off-site documentation such as the Bitcoin Wiki tends to use the terms big endian and little endian as shown in the table below, but they aren’t always consistent. Worse, these two different ways of representing a hash digest can confuse anyone who looks at the Bitcoin Core source code and finds a so-called “big endian” value being stored in a little-endian data type.

    <br>A Bitcoin wallet is the interface through which users will access the Bitcoin network and, more importantly, be able to utilize the Bitcoins that they own.
    <br>It can be procured for free as

    <br>- an application on a mobile device or

    <br>Bitcoin users manage their bitcoin addresses by using <strong>a digital wallet</strong>. Wallets let users send bitcoins, request payment, calculate the total balance of addresses in use, generate new addresses as needed. Many wallets include precautions to keep the private keys secret, for example by encrypting the wallet data with a password or by requiring two-factor authenticated logins.
    <br>
    <br>Bitcoin wallets provide the following functionality:[10]
    <br>    Storage of bitcoin addresses and corresponding public/private keys on user's computer in a wallet.dat file
    <br>    Conducting transactions of obtaining and transferring bitcoins (BTC), also without connection to the Internet
    <br>    Provide information about the balance in BTC at all available addresses, prior transactions, spare keys

    <br>Since Bitcoin is open-source, any computer programmer with the right skills can create a bitcoin wallet. A Bitcoin wallet is like an email account, they are typically free to install, and you can send and receive money.
    <br>
    <br>Some wallets have more features than others, and some wallets are more designed for advanced users. Some wallets store your bitcoins locally on the computer or mobile phone, and some wallets store your bitcoins in the cloud, where they can be accessed from anywhere.
    <br>
    <br>A wallet that holds bitcoins only is considered an Advanced wallet, or Expert wallet, regardless of the complexity of the interface. Because Bitcoin is new, the volatility risk of holding only bitcoins is more significant than the technical risk of using the software.
    <br>
    <br>Wallets in the Intermediate category allow you to store your local currency in the wallet, as well as bitcoins. This reduces the volatility risk to the user.

    <br>1) The payment system itself is revolutionary – nothing like it has ever been done. The system is decentralized, so there is no “server farm” or corporate office which controls payments. Transactions occur “peer to peer” just like file-sharing. To use the system, you can either download the client software (which runs on your computer and stores money locally) or you can use an “ewallet” which is a website run by a 3rd party which holds the funds for you (simpler, but introduces counter-party risk if the 3rd party is not trustworthy).

    <br>- Make a will or write down instructions about what should be done with your digital assets.
    <br>- Make backups of your wallets or at least ensure that you have keys kept somewhere securely.
    <br>- If you are using mobile wallets, make sure they are platform independent.

    <br>Το πρώτο «χρηματοκιβώτιο» για bitcoins
    <br>Δευτέρα, 13 Ιανουαρίου 2014 12:13 UPD:12:13
    <br>REUTERS/JIM URQUHART
    <br>Τα online «πορτοφόλια» που χρησιμοποιούνται για την αποθήκευση bitcoins θεωρούνται όλο και λιγότερο ασφαλή, καθώς είναι τρωτά σε κυβερνοεπιθέσεις.
    <br>Μία υπηρεσία για αποθήκευση καταθέσεων στο ψηφιακό νόμισμα, bitcoin, ξεκίνησε τη λειτουργία της στο Λονδίνο.
    <br>Σύμφωνα με δημοσίευμα του BBC, το Elliptic Vault χρησιμοποιεί τεχνικές «deep cold storage», όπου κωδικοποιημένα «κλειδιά» για bitcoins αποθηκεύονται σε servers οι οποίοι βρίσκονται σε ασφαλές σημείο και είναι αποκομμένοι από το Διαδίκτυο. Υπάρχουν πολλαπλά αντίγραφα των «κλειδιών», που προστατεύονται τόσο από ψηφιακά, όσο και από «φυσικά» συστήματα προστασίας. Στα εν λόγω αντίγραφα έχουν πρόσβαση μόνο ανώτερα στελέχη της εταιρείας. Οι δημιουργοί του ισχυρίζονται πως πρόκειται για μια παγκόσμια πρωτιά, με στόχο την παροχή ασφαλείας στους κατόχους bitcoins.
    <br>Σημειώνεται ότι τα online «πορτοφόλια» που χρησιμοποιούνται για την αποθήκευση bitcoins θεωρούνται όλο και λιγότερο ασφαλή, καθώς είναι τρωτά σε κυβερνοεπιθέσεις ενώ πολλοί χρήστες έχουν αναφέρει περιστατικά όπου χάθηκαν κατά λάθος τεράστια ποσά Χαρακτηριστικό παράδειγμα είναι η περίπτωση του Τζέιμς Χάουελς, ο οποίος πέταξε έναν σκληρό δίσκο στον οποίο είχε ξεχάσει ότι υπήρχαν από παλιά αποθηκευμένα bitcoins αξίας (σήμερα) εκατομμυρίων δολαρίων.
    <br>Δεν υπάρχει τρόπος ανάκτησης κλεμμένων bitcoins, ενώ οι συναλλαγές είναι μη αναστρέψιμες. Επίσης δεν υπάρχει κάποιος τρόπος ασφάλισής τους, όπως θα συνέβαινε σε μία «συμβατική» τράπεζα με κανονικά λεφτά.
    <br>«Ένας από τους κύριους προβληματισμούς που έχουν οι άνθρωποι με τα bitcoins είναι ότι είναι δύσκολο να τα αποθηκεύσουν με ασφάλεια» είπε στο BBC ο Τομ Ρόμπινσον, συνιδρυτής του Elliptic Vault. «Το να τους παρέχουμε αυτή την ασφάλεια φαινόταν το προφανές βήμα» πρόσθεσε.
    <br>Κατά τον Ρόμπινσον, ήταν δύσκολο να βρεθεί κάποια ασφαλιστική εταιρεία η οποία να υποστηρίξει το εγχείρημα, καθώς η σχετική βιομηχανία παρουσιάζεται πολύ συντηρητική και δεν «κατανοεί» ακόμα το bitcoin, ενώ επηρεάζεται και από την αρνητική δημοσιότητα πάνω στο ζήτημα. Ωστόσο, όπως επισημαίνει, η κατάσταση έχει βελτιωθεί από τότε που έκλεισε η online αγορά ναρκωτικών και άλλων παράνομων εμπορευμάτων, Silk Road.

  <p id="idBtcwltkypldsn">description::
    <br>Key_Pool:
    <br>Some wallet applications that create new <a class="clsPreview" href="#idBtcprk">private keys</a> randomly keep a pool of unused pre-generated keys (BitcoinQT keeps 100 keys by default).
    <br>When a new key is needed for *change* address or a new payment request, the application provides the oldest key from the pool and replaces it with a fresh one.
    <br>The purpose of the pool is to ensure that recently used keys are always already backed up on external storage.
    <br>Without a key pool you could create a new key, receive a payment on its address and then have your hard disk died before backing up this key.
    <br>A key pool guarantees that this key was already backed up several days before being used.
    <br>*Deterministic wallets* do not use a key pool because they need to back up a single secret key.

    <br>These include web wallets, desktop wallets installed on
    <br>your computer, hierarchical deterministic (“HD”) wallets, multiplesignature
    <br>(“multi-sig”) wallets, light wallets, paper wallets, and
    <br>wallets that require two-factor authentication (“2FA”).
    <br>These wallet characteristics are not mutually exclusive. For example,
    <br>you can have a web wallet that uses the multi-sig system or twofactor
    <br>authentication. You’ll find that some of the recommended
    <br>wallets appear in more than one category below.

    <br>Brain_wallet:
    <br>Brain wallet is a concept of storing *private keys* as <strong>a memorable phrase</strong> without any digital or paper trace.
    <br>Either a single key is used for a single address, or a *deterministic wallet* derived from a single key.
    <br>If done properly, a brain wallet greatly reduces the risk of theft because it is completely deniable: no one could say which or how much bitcoins you own as there are no actual wallet files to be found anywhere.
    <br>However, it is the most error-prone method as one can simply forget the secret phrase, or make it too simple for anyone to brute force and steal all the funds.
    <br>Additional risks are added by a complex wallet software.
    <br>E.g. BitcoinQT always sends *change* amount to a new address.
    <br>If a private key is imported temporarily to spend 1% of the funds and then the wallet is deleted, the remaining 99% will be lost forever as they are moved as a change to a completely new address.
    <br>This already happened to a number of people.

    <br>What if I receive a bitcoin when my computer is powered off?
    <br>This works fine. The bitcoins will appear next time you start your wallet application. Bitcoins are not actually received by the software on your computer, they are appended to a public ledger that is shared between all the devices on the network. If you are sent bitcoins when your wallet client program is not running and you later launch it, it will download blocks and catch up with any transactions it did not already know about, and the bitcoins will eventually appear as if they were just received in real time. Your wallet is only needed when you wish to spend bitcoins.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcwtpH3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idBtcwtpdsn">description::
    <br>The simplest wallet is a program which performs all three functions: it generates private keys, derives the corresponding public keys, helps distribute those public keys as necessary, monitors for outputs spent to those public keys, creates and signs transactions spending those outputs, and broadcasts the signed transactions.
    <br>As of this writing, almost all popular wallets can be used as full-service wallets.
    <br>The main advantage of full-service wallets is that they are easy to use. A single program does everything the user needs to receive and spend satoshis.
    <br><strong>The main disadvantage of full-service wallets is that they store the private keys on a device connected to the Internet. The compromise of such devices is a common occurrence, and an Internet connection makes it easy to transmit private keys from a compromised device to an attacker</strong>.
    <br>To help protect against theft, many wallet programs offer users the option of encrypting the wallet files which contain the private keys. This protects the private keys when they aren’t being used, but it cannot protect against an attack designed to capture the encryption key or to read the decrypted keys from memory.

    <br>Dash is like digital cash managed by a self funded, self governed organization comprised of over 15,000 users who move half a million dollars across the network every 24 hours. It can be spent instantly online and at merchants and service providers worldwide with transactions verified by miners and its system protected by 4,000 master nodes across the world. Its in-built governance and funding system allows projects to be proposed and voted on by the community, and if approved, paid for directly from the Blockchain.

  <p id="idBtcwtpOflndsn">description::
    <br>Several full-service wallets programs will also operate as two separate wallets: one program instance acting as a signing-only wallet (often called an “offline wallet”) and the other program instance acting as the networked wallet (often called an “online wallet” or “watching-only wallet”).
    <br>
    <br>The offline wallet is so named because it is intended to be run on a device which does not connect to any network, greatly reducing the number of attack vectors. If this is the case, it is usually up to the user to handle all data transfer using removable media such as USB drives. The user’s workflow is something like:
    <br>
    <br>(Offline) Disable all network connections on a device and install the wallet software. Start the wallet software in offline mode to create the parent private and public keys. Copy the parent public key to removable media.
    <br>
    <br>(Online) Install the wallet software on another device, this one connected to the Internet, and import the parent public key from the removable media. As you would with a full-service wallet, distribute public keys to receive payment. When ready to spend satoshis, fill in the output details and save the unsigned transaction generated by the wallet to removable media.
    <br>
    <br>(Offline) Open the unsigned transaction in the offline instance, review the output details to make sure they spend the correct amount to the correct address. This prevents malware on the online wallet from tricking the user into signing a transaction which pays an attacker. After review, sign the transaction and save it to removable media.
    <br>
    <br>(Online) Open the signed transaction in the online instance so it can broadcast it to the peer-to-peer network.
    <br>
    <br>The primary advantage of offline wallets is their possibility for greatly improved security over full-service wallets. As long as the offline wallet is not compromised (or flawed) and the user reviews all outgoing transactions before signing, the user’s satoshis are safe even if the online wallet is compromised.
    <br>
    <br>The primary disadvantage of offline wallets is hassle. For maximum security, they require the user dedicate a device to only offline tasks. The offline device must be booted up whenever funds are to be spent, and the user must physically copy data from the online device to the offline device and back.

    <br>A web service providing wallet functionality: ability to store, send and receive bitcoins.
    <br>User has to trust counter-party to keep their bitcoins securely and ready to redeem at any time.
    <br>It is very easy to build your own web wallet, so most of them were prone to hacks or outright fraud.
    <br>The most secure and respected web wallet is *Blockchain.info*.
    <br>Online exchanges also provide wallet functionality, so they can also be considered web wallets.
    <br>It is not recommended to store large amounts of bitcoins in a web wallet.

    <br><span class="clsU">A hardware wallet</span> is a special type of bitcoin wallet which stores the user's private keys in a secure hardware device.
    <br>
    <br>They have major advantages over standard software wallets:
    <br>
    <br>private keys are often stored in a protected area of a microcontroller, and cannot be transferred out of the device in plaintext
    <br>immune to computer viruses that steal from software wallets
    <br>can be used securely and interactively, as opposed to a paper wallet which must be imported to software at some point
    <br>much of the time, the software is open source, allowing a user to validate the entire operation of the device
    <br>This page is an attempt to summarize all the known developments of hardware wallets that can use Bitcoin as part of their operation.
    <br>[<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hardware_wallet">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hardware_wallet</a>]
    <br>===
    <br>Hardware wallets are devices dedicated to running a signing-only wallet. Their dedication lets them eliminate many of the vulnerabilities present in operating systems designed for general use, allowing them to safely communicate directly with other devices so users don’t need to transfer data manually. The user’s workflow is something like:
    <br>
    <br>(Hardware) Create parent private and public keys. Connect hardware wallet to a networked device so it can get the parent public key.
    <br>
    <br>(Networked) As you would with a full-service wallet, distribute public keys to receive payment. When ready to spend satoshis, fill in the transaction details, connect the hardware wallet, and click Spend. The networked wallet will automatically send the transaction details to the hardware wallet.
    <br>
    <br>(Hardware) Review the transaction details on the hardware wallet’s screen. Some hardware wallets may prompt for a passphrase or PIN number. The hardware wallet signs the transaction and uploads it to the networked wallet.
    <br>
    <br>(Networked) The networked wallet receives the signed transaction from the hardware wallet and broadcasts it to the network.
    <br>
    <br>The primary advantage of hardware wallets is their possibility for greatly improved security over full-service wallets with much less hassle than offline wallets.
    <br>
    <br>The primary disadvantage of hardware wallets is their hassle. Even though the hassle is less than that of offline wallets, the user must still purchase a hardware wallet device and carry it with them whenever they need to make a transaction using the signing-only wallet.
    <br>
    <br>An additional (hopefully temporary) disadvantage is that, as of this writing, very few popular wallet programs support hardware wallets—although almost all popular wallet programs have announced their intention to support at least one model of hardware wallet.

  <p id="idBtcwltHwrTrzrdsn">description::
    <br>TREZOR is a secure bitcoin storage and a transaction signing tool. The private keys are generated by the device and never leave it thus they cannot be accessed by a malware.
    <br>
    <br>It uses a deterministic wallet structure which means it can hold an unlimited number of keys (BIP 0032/BIP 0044). A recovery seed is generated when the device is initialized. In case TREZOR gets lost or stolen, all its contents can be recovered using this seed (private keys, bitcoin balance and transaction history) into a new device or another BIP 0039/BIP 0044 compatible wallet.
    <br>
    <br>TREZOR also introduced a unique way of PIN entering preventing keyloggers from recording it even when entered on a compromised computer. An encryption passphrase can be set on top of the PIN protection. More passphrases can be used for plausible deniability.

    <br>A collective term for different ways to generate a sequence of *private keys* and/or *public keys*. Deterministic wallet does not need a *Key Pool*.
    <br>The simplest form of a deterministic wallet is based on hashing a secret string concatenated with a key number.
    <br>For each number the resulting hash is used as a private key (public key is derived from it).
    <br>More complex scheme uses *elliptic curve arithmetic* to derive sequences of public and private keys separately which allows generating new *addresses* for every payment request without storing private keys on a web server.

  <p id="idBtcelnconP1">Problem::
    <br>3.  What are the major liabilities of bitcoin?  Is it associated with any major security problems?
    <br>
    <br>Disadvantages include:
    <br>
    <br>1. Steep learning curve
    <br>2. Requires personal responsibility (if you delete your wallet without making backups, your money is gone).
    <br>3. Value fluctuates and is relatively volatile (no guarantee that the price tomorrow will be the same as today).
    <br>
    <br>Regarding security problems – this is an important point. All of the “bitcoin hacks” and security breaches to date have not been against Bitcoin itself, but rather against various companies and individuals who did not secure things properly. Consider a bank that leaves its doors and vault unlocked at night… it will find a theft has occurred in the morning. This doesn’t mean the US dollar was hacked, or that banking as an institution is necessarily at fault, but simply that one specific bank screwed up. The same is true with Bitcoin.
    <br>
    <br>Frankly, it is very easy to lose your bitcoins if you are foolish, and it is very easy to never lose them if you are smart. The system requires some personal responsibility and due diligence. Because there is no company behind Bitcoin itself, there is no tech support you can call (this is the same with cash or bars of gold – if you lose them, they are gone, and nobody can get them back for you).
    <br>
    <br>4.  Is bitcoin commonly used to facilitate illegal transactions?  Is it, as it has been characterized, a currency of crime?
    <br>
    <br>Bitcoin, like any money, can be used for illegal transactions. Because of its private, secure nature, it is impossible to know the extent to which it is used for such purposes (just like we don’t know how much cash is used for illicit activity, but we all know that it happens).
    <br>
    <br>Certainly the media has characterized Bitcoin as a “currency of crime”, because A) they don’t understand it and B) crime makes a good news story. Bitcoin is a highly powerful technology (like fire, or automobiles, or the internet itself) and thus it carries risk and danger. It can be used for good or evil – Bitcoin is morally agnostic, it’s just a tool. Now, to be sure, it’s a very good tool , and this means criminals will love to use it, just as good people will love to use it.
    <br>
    <br>Likely for the foreseeable future, US dollar cash will remain the preferred currency of crime.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idBtcelnconP1"></a></p>
  <p id="idBtcelnconP2">Problem::
    <br>BITCOIN RISKS Do not invest anything in Bitcoin you can not afford to lose. Investing in Bitcoin or any other currency is not without risk. For example, any of the following could happen to Bitcoin:
    <br>Another crypto-currency might surpass Bitcoin
    <br>Several have already tried and failed.
    <br>A weakness in the encryption might be discovered
    <br>This is the same encryption used in online banking. Like banking systems, if a flaw is found in a particular algorithm, the Bitcoin client can be upgraded to use different encryption algorithms.
    <br>Governments might try to ban or regulate Bitcoin
    <br>This would be similar to the government banning the Internet because of illegal uses. Banning the Internet is unlikely because it would place the government and its people at a strategic communications disadvantage. Banning bitcoins, is similarly unlikely as it would place the government and its people at a strategic economic disadvantage.
    <br>An unfixable flaw might be discovered in the Bitcoin protocol
    <br>People have been trying to find a flaw for over two years.

    <br>Bitcoin 'at risk' of network attack
    <br>Man cashes in on $22 Bitcoin stash
    <br>A man who ran an online "wallet service" for storing Bitcoins has claimed hackers stole virtual currency from his site worth more than one million Australian dollars.
    <br>
    <br>The Australian man said 4,100 Bitcoins (US$1.04m, £650,000) were taken in two separate attacks.
    <br>
    <br>He said he would not report the theft to police as Bitcoin transactions are virtually impossible to trace.
    <br>
    <br>This has led some users to speculate whether it was an "inside job".
    <br>
    <br>In a radio interview with ABC News the man, who only used his online name TradeFortress, denied being involved.
    <br>
    <br>The Bitcoin virtual currency is increasingly used to pay for things online.
    <br>
    <br>According to the Sydney Morning Herald, the theft occurred on 26 October but users were only alerted this week via a message he posted on the wallet service's website.
    <br>
    <br>"I know this doesn't mean much, but I'm sorry, and saying that I'm very sad that this has happened is an understatement.
    <br>
    <br>"Please don't store Bitcoins on an internet-connected device, regardless if it is your own or a service's."
    <br>
    <br>Bitcoin is the most well known of a handful of virtual currencies. The currencies are developed through a computer process called "mining" and can be traded on exchanges or privately between users.

  <p id="idBtcpbmQntP1">The Economic Problem is entirely separate. Whereas the Security Problem may wreck BTC, if BTC is not wrecked and takes over a large macro-economy (as people abandon government issued money for BTC), it is BTC that will wreck the economy. Why? Because it is designed to mimic the Gold Standard – the monetary system that caused one depression after the other, from the 19th Century until 1929, and which was replaced because <span class="clsColorYellowBg">capitalism cannot breathe under a fixed quantity of money</span>.
    <br>Mr Nakamoto, BTC’s creator (whoever he, she or they may be) used ‘built-in scarcity’ in order to ensure that BTC would grow in value relative to the dollar, the euro, the yen etc. and thus attract ‘disciples’ to the BTC community. Unwittingly, however, Nakamoto was reinventing a deflationary currency by simulating a Gold Standard through the BTC algorithm. So, if the Security Problem does not shoot down BTC first, and BTC or something similar ‘takes over the world of money’, we are on our way to re-engineering the crashes of 1884,1890,1896,1901,1907 and 1929…

    <br>A condition in which more than half the computing power on a cryptocurrency network is controlled by a single miner or group of miners.
    <br>That amount of power theoretically makes them the authority on the network.
    <br>This means that every client on the network believes the attacker’s hashed transaction block.
    <br>This gives them control over the network, including the power to:
    <br>Issue a transaction that conflicts with someone else's.
    <br>Stop someone else's transaction from being confirmed.
    <br>Spend the same coins multiple times.
    <br>Prevent other miners from mining valid blocks.

    <br>===
    <br>51percent_Attack:
    <br>Also known as >50% attack or a *double spend* attack.
    <br>An attacker can make a payment, wait till the merchant accepts some number of *confirmations* and provides the service, then starts mining a parallel chain of blocks starting with a block before the transaction.
    <br>This parallel blockchain then includes another transaction that spends the same *outputs* on some other address.
    <br>When the parallel chain becomes more *difficult*, it is considered a *main chain* by all nodes and the original transaction becomes invalid.
    <br>Having more than a half of total *hashrate* guarantees possibility to overtake chain of any length, hence the name of an attack (strictly speaking, it is "more than 50%", not 51%).
    <br>Also, even 40% of hashrate allows making a double spend, but the chances are less than 100% and are diminishing exponentially with the number of confirmations that the merchant requires.
    <br>
    <br>This attack is considered theoretical as owning more than 50% of hashrate might be much more expensive than any gain from a *double spend*.
    <br>Another variant of an attack is to disrupt the network by mining empty blocks, censoring all transactions.
    <br>An attack can be mitigated by blacklisting blocks that most of "honest" miners consider abnormal.
    <br>Under normal conditions, miners and mining pools do not censor blocks and transactions as it may diminish trust in Bitcoin and thus their own investments.
    <br>51% attack is also mitigated by using *<a class="clsPreview" href="#idBtcblkchckpntdsn">checkpoints</a>* that prevent *reorganization* past the certain block.

    <br>Τετάρτη, 29 Ιανουαρίου 2014 16:06 UPD:16:11
    <br>REUTERS/LUCAS JACKSON
    <br>Ο αντιπρόεδρος του Ιδρύματος Bitcoin Τσάρλι Σρεμ κατά την έξοδό του από το Ομοσπονδιακό δικαστήριο του Μανχάταν στη Νέα Υόρκη.
    <br>
    <br>Για ξέπλυμα χρημάτων συνελήφθη την Κυριακή στο αεροδρόμιο Κένεντι της Νέας Υόρκης ο 24χρονος <strong>Τσάρλι Σρεμ</strong>, ένας εκ των πλέον επιφανών υποστηρικτών της καθιέρωσης του διαδικτυακού νομίσματος, Bitcoin.
    <br>Ο Σρεμ συνελήφθη κατόπιν έρευνας της αμερικανικής υπηρεσίας Δίωξης Ναρκωτικών (DEA), καθώς κατηγορείται ότι, μαζί με συνεργό του, χρησιμοποίησαν bitcoins για να «ξεπλύνουν» χρήματα από πωλήσεις ναρκωτικών που σχετίζονταν με τη διαβόητη online αγορά Silk Road (η λειτουργία του τερματίστηκε κατόπιν επέμβασης των αρχών τον Οκτώβριο).
    <br>Σημειώνεται ότι ο Σρεμ ήταν αντιπρόεδρος του Ιδρύματος Bitcoin (Bitcoin Foundation), που έχει ως στόχο την καθιέρωση/ ευρεία αποδοχή του διαδικτυακού νομίσματος, και διευθύνων σύμβουλος, συνιδρυτής και επιβλέπων του ανταλλακτηρίου BitInstant.com.
    <br>Όπως έγινε γνωστό την Τρίτη, ο Σρεμ παραιτήθηκε από τη θέση του ως αντιπροέδρου του ιδρύματος μετά τη σύλληψή του.
    <br>Επίσης, συνελήφθη και ο 52χρονος Ρόμπερτ Φαϊέλα, (BTCKing) στη Φλόριντα.
    <br>Ειδικότερα, ο Σρεμ κατηγορείται ότι επέτρεψε στον Φαϊέλα να χρησιμοποιήσει το BitInstant για να αγοράσει μεγάλα ποσά bitcoins (αξίας ενός εκατ. δολαρίων), για να τα πουλήσει σε χρήστες του Silk Road που επιθυμούσαν να αγοράσουν ναρκωτικά. Σύμφωνα με τις αρχές, ο Σρεμ ήξερε ότι τα bitcoins προορίζονταν για αυτή τη χρήση.

    <br>Εκπρόσωπος του Bitcoin Foundation εξέφρασε την έκπληξη του ιδρύματος από την εξέλιξη της υπόθεσης, διαχωρίζοντας τη θέση του από τις συγκεκριμένες δραστηριότητες.
    <br>Το BitInstant ήταν ένα από τα μεγαλύτερα ανταλλακτήρια bitcoins στο Ίντερνετ, ωστόσο η πρόσβαση σε αυτό δεν ήταν δυνατή για κάποιο χρονικό διάστημα, όπως δήλωσε στο BBC ο Μάικ Χιρν, στέλεχος του συμβουλίου του Bitcoin Foundation.

    <br>So remember: 99% of cloud mining companies are scams.

    <br>Digital currency exchangers (DCEs) or Bitcoin exchanges are businesses that allow customers to trade digital currencies for other assets, such as conventional fiat money, or different digital currencies.[1] They can be market makers that typically take the bid/ask spreads as transaction commissions for their services or simply charge fees as a matching platform.[1]
    <br>DCEs may be brick-and-mortar businesses, exchanging traditional payment methods and digital currencies, or strictly online businesses, exchanging electronically transferred money and digital currencies.[2] Most digital currency exchanges operate outside of Western countries, avoiding regulatory oversight and complicating prosecutions, but DCEs often handle Western fiat currencies, sometimes maintaining bank accounts in several countries to facilitate deposits in various national currencies.[3][4] They may accept credit card payments, wire transfers, postal money orders, or other forms of payment in exchange for digital currencies, and many can convert digital currency balances into anonymous prepaid cards which can be used to withdraw funds from ATMs worldwide.[3][4]
    <br>Some digital currencies are backed by real-world commodities such as gold.[5]
    <br>Creators of digital currencies are often independent of the DCEs that trade the currency.[4] In one type of system, digital currency providers, or DCPs, are businesses that keep and administer accounts for their customers, but generally do not issue digital currency to those customers directly.[2][6] Customers buy or sell digital currency from DCEs, who transfer the digital currency into or out of the customer's DCP account.[6] Some DCEs are subsidiaries of DCP, but many are legally independent businesses.[2] The denomination of funds kept in DCP accounts may be of a real or fictitious currency.[6]

    <br>The easiest way to obtain bitcoins is to receive them from another person. This can be done as an in-person trade, or you can accept bitcoins for your business using some business tools.
    <br>
    <br>It is also easy to buy bitcoins at a currency exchange. There are many online currency exchanges that let you buy and sell bitcoins for US Dollars, Euros, Pounds, and many other currencies.
    <br>
    <br>You can fund your exchange account with a cash deposit or electronic funds transfer. To learn more about cash deposits, visit BitInstant.com.

    <br>5. Could you speculate on what the future may hold for bitcoin specifically and digital currencies generally?
    <br>
    <br>First it’s important to recognize that most “digital currencies” are not really digital currencies at all, because they are pegged to standard currencies. Credits in your Paypal account are really just USD-backed; they are not a unique currency themselves. Other “digital currencies” such as Facebook Credits, can be created out of nothing and without limit, so they are not serious money (ironically, the USD is more like Facebook Credits than Bitcoin, because both USD and Facebook Credits can be created out of thin air, whereas Bitcoin cannot be).
    <br>
    <br>So Bitcoin is the first, what should be called “true” digital currency. It is a scarce, digital commodity with properties that make it perfect for use as money, and so it is used for this purpose.
    <br>
    <br>As the world starts to realize the benefits of a real digital currency, it will become used in countless ways. It will become as ubiquitous as email (and for the very same reason – email made the cost of written communication near-zero and Bitcoin makes the cost of monetary communication near-zero). Really, there is no reason it should cost $45 to send a “wire transfer” of money between two people. The bank is just changing digital numbers in a digital database – why does it cost $45 and take 3 days?  It’s absurd, and Bitcoin finally offers a real alternative.
    <br>
    <br>Bitcoin is an invention which people will look back upon and say, “wow, that was obviously needed,” just as we look back on the internet today. And, like the internet, Bitcoin will change the way people interact and do business around the world. But, it’s a process that takes years, and it’s only just getting started.

  <p id="idBtcelnproP2">2. What are the major advantages of bitcoin?  How does bitcoin differ from other international payment systems like PayPal?
    <br>
    <br>Advantages include:
    <br>
    <br>1. Zero fee to transfer money
    <br>2. Transfers are instant. No holiday or weekend delays.
    <br>3. Works globally, no territory restrictions
    <br>4. Enables the storage and transfer of wealth with zero counter-party risk (ie – you don’t have to trust anyone)
    <br>5. Excellent hedge against monetary debasement (inflation)
    <br>6. Any amount can be sent (perfect for microtransactions under a penny, for example)
    <br>7. Zero chargeback risk (this means, once a merchant receives Bitcoin, there is no risk of a payment reversal or fraud. The funds are immediately “good”)
    <br>8. Ability to move around capital controls (for example, to get money out of China or Argentina)
    <br>9. Anyone can accept and use Bitcoin.
    <br>10. Open-source, continually upgradable. Anyone can adapt and improve the software and build with it.
    <br>
    <br>How does this differ from PayPal?  PayPal doesn’t share any of the above advantages, except perhaps for number 2. It’s important to realize that PayPal is just a payment system for US dollars using the traditional banking infrastructure, while Bitcoin is a payment system for its own currency unit: bitcoins, and is entirely separate from the traditional banking infrastructure.

  <p id="idBtcelnproP3">BITCOIN IS BETTER THAN REGULAR CURRENCIESSome of the reasons Bitcoin is better than regular currencies:
    <br>Bitcoin is an international currency.
    <br>Bitcoin can be spent all over the world.
    <br>Bitcoins cannot be counterfeited.
    <br>There is no printing technology that will ever be able to fool the bitcoin network.
    <br>Bitcoin cannot be devalued.
    <br>Only 21 million bitcoins will ever be issued. Unlike regular currencies, since Bitcoin is not controlled by any government or bank, the raising of a debt ceiling and quantitative easing can not devalue bitcoins.

    <br>Today the Bitcoin network is restricted to a sustained rate of <strong>7 tps</strong> due to the bitcoin protocol restricting block sizes to 1MB.
    <br>VISA handles on average around 2,000 transactions per second (tps), so call it a daily peak rate of 4,000 tps. It has a peak capacity of around 56,000 transactions per second, [1] however they never actually use more than about a third of this even during peak shopping periods. [2]
    <br>PayPal, in contrast, handles around 10 million transactions per day for an average of 115 tps. [3]
    <br>Let's take 4,000 tps as starting goal. Obviously if we want Bitcoin to scale to all economic transactions worldwide, including cash, it'd be a lot higher than that, perhaps more in the region of a few hundred thousand tps. And the need to be able to withstand DoS attacks (which VISA does not have to deal with) implies we would want to scale far beyond the standard peak rates. Still, picking a target let us do some basic calculations even if it's a little arbitrary.

    <br>BITCOIN IS BETTER THAN GOLDFor thousands of years, gold has been one of the safest stores of value. Many people hold gold to reduce their fiat risk. Bitcoin has many advantages over gold:
    <br>Gold is not divisible
    <br>You can not easily cut up gold to give people small amounts. Bitcoin is easily divisible to 8 decimal places.
    <br>Gold is not instantly assayable
    <br>You can’t instantly tell if gold is pure. You can instantly prove you have real bitcoins.
    <br>Gold is not instantly weighable
    <br>You need a scale to weigh gold. You can instantly prove how many bitcoins you have.
    <br>Gold is not transmittable over the Internet
    <br>Sending gold notes has counterparty risk. Bitcoins are easily sent on the Internet.
    <br>Gold can be outlawed and confiscated
    <br>The US government can and has in the past made it illegal to own gold. You can memorize your Bitcoin private key.

    <br>The legal status of bitcoin varies substantially from country to country and is still undefined or changing in many of them.
    <br>While some countries have explicitly allowed its use and trade, others have banned or severely restricted it.
    <br>Likewise, various government agencies, departments, and courts have classified bitcoins differently.
    <br>While this article provides the legal status of bitcoin, regulations and bans that apply to this cryptocurrency likely extend to similar systems as well.
    <br>Steven Strauss, a Harvard public policy professor, suggested that governments could outlaw bitcoin in April 2013,[1] and this possibility was mentioned again in a July 2013 regulatory filing made by a bitcoin investment vehicle.[2]
    <br>However, the vast majority of nations have not done so as of 2014.
    <br>Bitcoin is illegal in Bangladesh,[3] Bolivia,[4] Ecuador,[5] Kyrgyzstan,[6] Russia,[7] and Vietnam.[8]
    <br>It has also been reported illegal in Indonesia.[9]

    <br>Bitcoins are illegal because they're not legal tender
    <br>
    <br>In March 2013, the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issues a new set of guidelines on "de-centralized virtual currency", clearly targeting Bitcoin. Under the new guidelines, "a user of virtual currency is not a Money Services Businesses (MSB) under FinCEN's regulations and therefore is not subject to MSB registration, reporting, and record keeping regulations." [2] Miners, when mining bitcoins for their own personal use, aren't required to register as a MSB or Money Transmitter. [3]
    <br>
    <br>In general, there are a number of currencies in existence that are not official government-backed currencies. A currency is, after all, nothing more than a convenient unit of account. While national laws may vary from country to country, and you should certainly check the laws of your jurisdiction, in general trading in any commodity, including digital currency like Bitcoin, BerkShares, game currencies like WoW gold, or Linden dollars, is not illegal.

    <br>Bitcoins will be shut down by the government just like Liberty Dollars were
    <br>
    <br>Liberty Dollars started as a commercial venture to establish an alternative US currency, including physical banknotes and coins, backed by precious metals. This, in and of itself, is not illegal. They were prosecuted under counterfeiting laws because the silver coins allegedly resembled US currency.
    <br>
    <br>Bitcoins do not resemble the currency of the US or of any other nation in any way, shape, or form. The word "dollar" is not attached to them in any way. The "$" symbol is not used in any way.
    <br>
    <br>Bitcoins have no representational similarity whatsoever to US dollars.
    <br>
    <br>Of course, actually 'shutting down' Liberty Dollars was as easy as arresting the head of the company and seizing the offices and the precious metals used as backing. The decentralized Bitcoin, with no leader, no servers, no office, and no tangible asset backing, does not have the same vulnerability.

    <br>Με το ψηφιακό νόμισμα, bitcoin, θα μπορούν να πληρώνουν τους λογαριασμούς του κάτοικοι στην πόλη Zug της Ελβετίας καθώς ξεκινά η εφαρμογή του εν λόγω πιλτικού προγράμματος από την 1η Ιουλίου. ο δήμαρχος της πόλης Dolfi M?ller ελπίζει πως με αυτό τον τρόπο θα προσελκύσει περισσότερες οικονομικές επιχειρήσεις και τεχνολογικές εταιρείες ώστε να εγκατασταθούν στην περιοχή. Για την ιστορία, έχουν γίνει και παρόμοιες προσπάθειες και σε άλλες χώρες χωρίς όμως άκρως ικανοποιητικά αποτελέσματα.
    <br>«Το πιλοτικό πρόγραμμα της κυβέρνησης της πόλης αρχικά βάζει 200 φράγκα όριο για τις δημόσιες συναλλαγές. Στα τέλη του 2016 θα γίνει και η αξιολόγηση του προγράμματος. Τότε ... το δημοτικό συμβούλιο θα αποφασίσει εάν το bitcoin και τα περισσότερα άλλα ψηφιακά νομίσματα μπορούν να γίνουν αποδεκτά ως τρόπος πληρωμής και σε άλλες υπηρεσίες στο μέλλον» αναφέρει χαρακτηριστικά η ανακοίνωση.

    <br>Πληρωμές διδάκτρων με Bitcoins στο Πανεπιστήμιο της Λευκωσίας
    <br>Παρασκευή, 22 Νοεμβρίου 2013 14:41 UPD:14:45
    <br>Η είδηση κάνει το γύρο του κόσμου, καθώς το κυπριακό πανεπιστήμιο παράλληλα παρέχει και τη δυνατότητα για σπουδές διαδικτυακού συναλλάγματος, με σκοπό την καλύτερη κατανόηση του νέου φαινομένου.
    <br>Το πρώτο πανεπιστήμιο στον κόσμο το οποίο θα δέχεται πληρωμές διδάκτρων και άλλων τελών με bitcoins θα αποτελέσει το Πανεπιστήμιο της Λευκωσίας, όπως ανακοινώθηκε.
    <br>Η είδηση κάνει το γύρο του κόσμου, καθώς το κυπριακό πανεπιστήμιο παράλληλα παρέχει και τη δυνατότητα για σπουδές διαδικτυακού συναλλάγματος, με σκοπό την καλύτερη κατανόηση του νέου φαινομένου.
    <br>Το Πανεπιστήμιο της Λευκωσίας (UNic) αποτελεί το μεγαλύτερο ιδιωτικό πανεπιστήμιο στην Κύπρο και ένα από τα μεγαλύτερα αγγλόφωνα πανεπιστήμια στη Μεσόγειο.  Πέρα από τις πληρωμές, οι φοιτητές του θα έχουν τη δυνατότητα σπουδών και πάνω στο ίδιο το αντικείμενο, στο πλαίσιο του MSc Degree in Digital Currency, το οποίο είναι σχεδιασμένο για να βοηθήσει τον κάθε ενδιαφερόμενο, από τον χώρο των επιχειρήσεων ή της δημόσιας διοίκησης να καταλάβει καλύτερα τα τεχνικά χαρακτηριστικά του διαδικτυακού νομίσματος, το οποίο «πιθανότατα θα αλληλεπιδράσει με τα υπάρχοντα χρηματοοικονομικά συστήματα», καθώς και θα εξετάζει τις ευκαιρίες για καινοτομία που συνεπάγονται τα συστήματα ψηφιακών συναλλαγμάτων.
    <br>«Γνωρίζουμε ότι το ψηφιακό συνάλλαγμα αποτελεί μία αναπόφευκτη τεχνική εξέλιξη η οποία θα οδηγήσει σε σημαντικές καινοτομίες στο online εμπόριο, τα οικονομικά συστήματα, τις διεθνείς πληρωμές και εμβάσματα και την παγκόσμια οικονομική ανάπτυξη. Το ψηφιακό συνάλλαγμα θα δημιουργήσει πιο αποτελεσματικές υπηρεσίες και θα λειτουργήσει ως μηχανισμός για την εξάπλωση των οικονομικών υπηρεσιών σε τομείς του κόσμου που δεν έχουν μεγάλη τραπεζική υποστήριξη» δήλωσε ο Δρ. Χρήστος Βλάχος, μέλος του συμβουλίου του Πανεπιστημίου.
    <br>«Θεωρούμε πρέπον να υιοθετήσουμε ψηφιακό συνάλλαγμα ως μία μέθοδο πληρωμών σε όλα τα ιδρύματά μας, σε όλες τις πόλεις και χώρες όπου λειτουργούμε» πρόσθεσε.
    <br>Το εν λόγω Master θα διδάσκεται στην αγγλική γλώσσα, τόσο στο campus όσο και online, με τα μαθήματα να ξεκινούν την άνοιξη του 2014. Επίσης, αξίζει να σημειωθεί ότι το UNic προτείνει στην κυπριακή κυβέρνηση την δημιουργία ενός εκτενούς πλαισίου λειτουργίας με σκοπό την εξέλιξη της Κύπρου σε ένα «κέντρο» για εμπόριο, διαχείριση και τραπεζικές συναλλαγές που αφορούν σε Bitcoins.

    <br>Aussie start-up to delay bitcoin transactions through anchoring 1.5bn votes to the Bitcoin blockchain over 24 hours starting 16:00, March 6 (GMT)
    <br>Stress-test of SecureVote will use 4% of bitcoin network capacity over 24 hours and delay some transactions by over 30 minutes – transaction backlog will take a maximum of 24 hours to clear
    <br><strong>Sydney (March 5, 2017)</strong>:
    <br>Australian secure voting start-up XO.1 announced a planned stress-test of their SecureVote application on March 6 GMT, which is planned to use more than 4% of the Bitcoin transaction network verification capacity.
    <br>This  stress-test  will  process  the  equivalent  of  1.5  billion  electronic  votes,  verified  on  the  Bitcoin blockchain network, over 24 hours, and during peak periods will delay some transactions by up to 30 minutes.
    <br>Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of XO.1, Max Kaye, explained that the intent of the stresstest was to ensure the scalability and reliability of XO.1’s proprietary verification layer, and apologised for any inconvenience caused to bitcoin users.
    <br>“We’re  building  the  world’s  most  secure  voting  technology,  and  while  there  aren’t  currently  any elections which would require 1.5bn votes, to prove the reliability and scalability of this technology we made the decision to conduct a stress-test a multitude of times larger than our expected first use cases,” said Mr Kaye.
    <br>“Unfortunately, this will cause disruption to some bitcoin users as we will be paying a fee to prioritise
    <br>the processing of our  transactions. At  the network’s anticipated peak processing  times, we’ll delay
    <br>some transactions by up to 30 minutes, and create a backlog of transactions that will take a maximum of 24 hours to clear.”
    <br>SecureVote is the world’s first high-throughput commercially viable secure, verifiable, auditable, and scalable internet voting system, with voting delivered via smart-phone app and local electronic voting machines.
    <br>XO.1’s proprietary Copperfield algorithm enables verification of the vote and the vote count without compromising the privacy of the vote itself.
    <br>The start-up, which has received $500,000 of early-stage funding to date, is expecting to reach market with a product by the end of 2017.
    <br>“A number of technological advances in the past ten years have made this product possible – primarily the development of the blockchain, which ensures we have an immutable record of votes cast, once they’ve been verified,” said Mr Kaye.
    <br>“We’ll shortly be commencing another funding round which will allow us to quickly scale and capitalise on our early lead in the space,” concluded Mr Kaye.

Nakamoto combined several prior inventions such as b-money and HashCash to create a completely decentralized electronic cash system that does not rely on a central authority for currency issuance or settlement and validation of transactions. The key innovation was to use a distributed computation system (called a "proof-of-work" algorithm) to conduct a global "election" every 10 minutes, allowing the decentralized network to arrive at consensus about the state of transactions. This elegantly solves the issue of double-spend where a single currency unit can be spent twice. Previously, the double-spend problem was a weakness of digital currency and was addressed by clearing all transactions through a central clearinghouse.

At this point it is expected that more than 90% of the computational capacity that secures the Bitcoin network will carry on mining on top of this large block.
    <br>The upgrade to 2MB blocks has been agreed first during the Bitcoin Roundtable Consensus in Hong-Kong on February 2016, and then ratified by the Bitcoin Scaling Agreement in New York on May 2017.

    <br>On Chain Scalability - Bitcoin Cash follows the Nakamoto roadmap of global adoption with on-chain scaling. As a first step, the blocksize limit has been made adjustable, with an increased default of 8MB. Research is underway to allow massive future increases.
    <br>New Transaction Signatures - A new SigHash type provides replay protection, improved hardware wallet security, and elimination of the quadratic hashing problem.
    <br>Emergency Difficulty Adjustment (EDA) - Responsive Proof-of-Work difficulty adjustment allows miners to migrate from the legacy Bitcoin chain as desired, while providing protection against hashrate fluctuations.
    <br>Decentralized Development - With multiple independent teams of developers providing software implementations, the future is secure. Bitcoin Cash is resistant to political and social attacks on protocol development. No single group or project can control it. The bitcoin-ml mailing list is a good venue for making proposals for changes that require coordination across development teams.

  <p id="idBtcnetHfkdsn">description::
    <br>A hardfork is a change to the bitcoin protocol that makes previously invalid blocks/transactions valid, and therefore requires all users to upgrade.
    <br>Any alteration to bitcoin which changes the block structure (including block hash), difficulty rules, or increases the set of valid transactions is a hardfork. However, some of these changes can be implemented by having the new transaction appear to older clients as a pay-to-anybody transaction (of a special form), and getting the miners to agree to reject blocks including the pay-to-anybody transaction unless the transaction validates under the new rules. This is known as a softfork, and how P2SH was added to Bitcoin.

  <p id="idBtcnetSfkdsn">description::
    <br>A softfork is a change to the bitcoin protocol wherein only previously valid blocks/transactions are made invalid. Since old nodes will recognise the new blocks as valid, a softfork is backward-compatible. This kind of fork requires only a majority of the miners upgrading to enforce the new rules.
    <br>New transaction types can often be added as softforks, requiring only that the participants (sender and receiver) and miners understand the new transaction type. This is done by having the new transaction appear to older clients as a "pay-to-anybody" transaction (of a special form), and getting the miners to agree to reject blocks including these transaction unless the transaction validates under the new rules. This is how P2SH was added to Bitcoin.

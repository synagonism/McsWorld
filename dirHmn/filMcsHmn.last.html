  <p id="idDescription">description::
    <br>"Humans (Homo sapiens) are the only extant members of the subtribe Hominina. Together with chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans, they are part of the family Hominidae (the great apes, or hominids). A terrestrial animal, humans are characterized by their erect posture and bipedal locomotion; high manual dexterity and heavy tool use compared to other animals; open-ended and complex language use compared to other animal communications; larger, more complex brains than other animals; and highly advanced and organized societies.[3][4]
    <br>Early hominins—particularly the australopithecines, whose brains and anatomy are in many ways more similar to ancestral non-human apes—are less often referred to as "human" than hominins of the genus Homo.[5] Several of these hominins used fire, occupied much of Eurasia, and gave rise to anatomically modern Homo sapiens in Africa about 315,000[6] years ago.[7][8] Humans began to exhibit evidence of behavioral modernity around 50,000 years ago, and in several waves of migration, they ventured out of Africa and populated most of the world.[9]
    <br>The spread of the large and increasing population of humans has profoundly affected much of the biosphere and millions of species worldwide. Advantages that explain this evolutionary success include a larger brain with a well-developed neocortex, prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes, which enable advanced abstract reasoning, language, problem solving, sociality, and culture through social learning. Humans use tools more frequently and effectively than any other animal; and are the only extant species to build fires, cook food, clothe themselves, and create and use numerous other technologies and arts.
    <br>Humans uniquely use such systems of symbolic communication as language and art to express themselves and exchange ideas, and also organize themselves into purposeful groups. Humans create complex social structures composed of many cooperating and competing groups, from families and kinship networks to political states. Social interactions between humans have established an extremely wide variety of values,[10] social norms, and rituals, which together undergird human society. Curiosity and the human desire to understand and influence the environment and to explain and manipulate phenomena (or events) have motivated humanity's development of science, philosophy, mythology, religion, anthropology, and numerous other fields of knowledge.
    <br>Though most of human existence has been sustained by hunting and gathering in band societies,[11] increasingly many human societies transitioned to sedentary agriculture approximately some 10,000 years ago,[12] domesticating plants and animals, thus enabling the growth of civilization. These human societies subsequently expanded, establishing various forms of government, religion, and culture around the world, and unifying people within regions to form states and empires. The rapid advancement of scientific and medical understanding in the 19th and 20th centuries permitted the development of fuel-driven technologies and increased lifetimes, causing the human population to rise exponentially. The global human population was estimated to be near 7.7 billion in 2019.[13]"

  <p id="idHmnatt032dsn">description::
    <br>"Discrimination is the act of making distinctions between human beings based on the groups, classes, or other categories to which they are perceived to belong. People may discriminate on the basis of age, caste, criminal record, height, weight, physical appearance, disability, family status, gender identity, gender expression, generation, genetic characteristics, marital status, nationality, Profession, color, race and ethnicity, religion, sex and sex characteristics, sexual orientation, political ideology, social class, personality, as well as other categories. Discrimination occurs when individuals or groups are treated "in a way which is worse than the way people are usually treated," on the basis of their actual or perceived membership in certain groups or social categories.[1] It involves the group's initial reaction or interaction going on to influence the individual's actual behavior towards the group's leader or the group, restricting members of one group from opportunities or privileges that are available to members of another group, leading to the exclusion of the individual or entities based on illogical or irrational decision making.[2]
    <br>Discriminatory traditions, policies, ideas, practices and laws exist in many countries and institutions in all parts of the world, including territories where discrimination is generally looked down upon. In some places, attempts such as quotas have been used to benefit those who are believed to be current or past victims of discrimination. These attempts have often been met with controversy, and have sometimes been called reverse discrimination."

    <br>"Conscientiousness is the personality trait of being careful, or diligent. Conscientiousness implies a desire to do a task well, and to take obligations to others seriously. Conscientious people tend to be efficient and organized as opposed to easy-going and disorderly. They exhibit a tendency to show self-discipline, act dutifully, and aim for achievement; they display planned rather than spontaneous behavior; and they are generally dependable. It is manifested in characteristic behaviors such as being neat, and systematic; also including such elements as carefulness, thoroughness, and deliberation (the tendency to think carefully before acting).[1]
    <br>Conscientiousness is one of the five traits of both the Five Factor Model and the HEXACO model of personality and is an aspect of what has traditionally been referred to as having character. Conscientious individuals are generally hard-working, and reliable. They are also likely to be conformists.[2] When taken to an extreme, they may also be "workaholics", perfectionists, and compulsive in their behavior.[3] People who score low on conscientiousness tend to be laid back, less goal-oriented, and less driven by success; they also are more likely to engage in antisocial and criminal behavior.[4]"

    <br>"Bullying is the use of force, coercion, or threat, to abuse, aggressively dominate or intimidate. The behavior is often repeated and habitual. One essential prerequisite is the perception (by the bully or by others) of an imbalance of physical or social power. This imbalance distinguishes bullying from conflict.[1] Bullying is a subcategory of aggressive behavior characterized by the following three minimum criteria: (1) hostile intent, (2) imbalance of power, and (3) repetition over a period of time.[2] Bullying is the activity of repeated, aggressive behavior intended to hurt another individual, physically, mentally, or emotionally.
    <br>Bullying ranges from one-on-one, individual bullying through to group bullying, called mobbing, in which the bully may have one or more "lieutenants" who are willing to assist the primary bully in their bullying activities. Bullying in school and the workplace is also referred to as "peer abuse".[3] Robert W. Fuller has analyzed bullying in the context of rankism. The Swedish-Norwegian researcher Dan Olweus says bullying occurs when a person is "exposed, repeatedly and over time, to negative actions on the part of one or more other persons",[4] and that negative actions occur "when a person intentionally inflicts injury or discomfort upon another person, through physical contact, through words or in other ways".[4] Individual bullying is usually characterized by a person behaving in a certain way to gain power over another person.[5]
    <br>A bullying culture can develop in any context in which humans interact with each other. This may include school, family, the workplace,[6] the home, and neighborhoods. The main platform for bullying in contemporary culture is on social media websites.[7] In a 2012 study of male adolescent American football players, "the strongest predictor [of bullying] was the perception of whether the most influential male in a player's life would approve of the bullying behavior."[8]
    <br>Bullying may be defined in many different ways. In the United Kingdom, there is no legal definition of bullying,[9] while some states in the United States have laws against it.[10] Bullying is divided into four basic types of abuse – psychological (sometimes called emotional or relational), verbal, physical, and cyber.[11]
    <br>Behaviors used to assert such domination may include physical assault or coercion, verbal harassment, or threat, and such acts may be directed repeatedly toward particular targets. Rationalizations of such behavior sometimes include differences of social class, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, appearance, behavior, body language, personality, reputation, lineage, strength, size, or ability.[12][13][14] If bullying is done by a group, it is called mobbing.[15]"

    <br>Does Bullying End after High School?
    <br>Research shows that "unattractive" people face bullying at work, along with fewer promotions and more menial tasks.
    <br>For some people, the childish cruelty often associated with high school cliques never really goes away. Research published in the journal Human Performance found that these juvenile mindsets, where attractive students are considered popular and unattractive kids are demeaned and bullied, often carries over into the workplace.

    <br>"Biologically, a child (plural children) is a human being between the stages of birth and puberty,[1][2] or between the developmental period of infancy and puberty.[3] The legal definition of child generally refers to a minor, otherwise known as a person younger than the age of majority.[1] Children generally have fewer rights and less responsibility than adults. They are classed as unable to make serious decisions, and legally must be under the care of their parents or another responsible caregiver.
    <br>Child may also describe a relationship with a parent (such as sons and daughters of any age)[4] or, metaphorically, an authority figure, or signify group membership in a clan, tribe, or religion; it can also signify being strongly affected by a specific time, place, or circumstance, as in "a child of nature" or "a child of the Sixties".[5]"
    <br>[{2020-05-03} https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child]
    <br>===
    <br>"In law, a minor is a person under a certain age, usually the age of majority, which legally demarcates childhood from adulthood. The age of majority depends upon jurisdiction and application, but it is generally 18. Minor may also be used in contexts that are unconnected to the overall age of majority. For example, the drinking age in the United States is usually 21, and younger people are sometimes called minors in the context of alcohol law, even if they are at least 18.[1][2] The term underage often refers to those under the age of majority, but it may also refer to persons under a certain age limit, such as the drinking age, smoking age, age of consent, marriageable age, driving age, voting age, etc. Such age limits are often different from the age of majority.
    <br>The concept of minor is not sharply defined in most jurisdictions. The age of criminal responsibility and consent, the age at which school attendance is no longer compulsory, the age at which legally binding contracts can be entered into, and so on may be different from one another.
    <br>In many countries, including Australia, India, Brazil, Croatia, and Colombia, a minor is defined as a person under the age of 18. In the United States, where the age of majority is set by the individual states, minor usually refers to someone under the age of 18 but can, in some states, be used in certain areas (such as casino gambling, handgun ownership and the consuming of alcohol) to define someone under the age of 21. In the criminal justice system in some places, "minor" is not entirely consistent, as a minor may be tried and punished for a crime either as a "juvenile" or, usually only for "extremely serious crimes" such as murder and/or theft, as an "adult".
    <br>In Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand, a minor is a person under 20 years of age. In New Zealand law, the age of majority is 20 years of age as well,[3] but most of the rights of adulthood are assumed at lower ages: for example, entering contracts and having a will are allowed at 15.[4]"

    <br>"Biologically, an adult is an organism that has reached sexual maturity. In human context, the term adult additionally has meanings associated with social and legal concepts. In contrast to a "minor", a legal adult is a person who has attained the age of majority and is therefore regarded as independent, self-sufficient, and responsible. The typical age of attaining legal adulthood is 18, although definition may vary by legal rights and country.
    <br>Human adulthood encompasses psychological adult development. Definitions of adulthood are often inconsistent and contradictory; a person may be biologically an adult, and have adult behavior but still be treated as a child if they are under the legal age of majority. Conversely, one may legally be an adult but possess none of the maturity and responsibility that may define an adult character.
    <br>In different cultures there are events that relate passing from being a child to becoming an adult or coming of age. This often encompasses the passing a series of tests to demonstrate that a person is prepared for adulthood, or reaching a specified age, sometimes in conjunction with demonstrating preparation. Most modern societies determine legal adulthood based on reaching a legally specified age without requiring a demonstration of physical maturity or preparation for adulthood."

    <br>· How Many People Have Lived on Earth since Mankind Began?
    <br>Population researchers estimate that 108 billion people have lived since modern humans appeared 50,000 years ago.
    <br>As you read this, there are approximately 7.7 billion other people on the planet with you. That might seem like a lot, but look at it this way and your perspective might change: the current world population is only about 7 percent of all the people who have ever lived. According to the Population Reference Bureau, which makes regular updates to its statistics, more than 108 billion people have roamed the Earth since behaviorally and anatomically modern humans first appeared approximately 50,000 years ago.
    <br>The bureau acknowledges that much of its work is based on speculation, since there is no accurate data for 99 percent of the time mankind has existed, but figures can be approximated by looking at the length of time Homo sapiens have been around and the average size of the population at different times.

    <br>"An interpersonal relationship is a strong, deep, or close association or acquaintance between two or more people that may range in duration from brief to enduring. The context can vary from family or kinship relations, friendship, marriage, relations with associates, work, clubs, neighborhoods, and places of worship. Relationships may be regulated by law, custom, or mutual agreement, and form the basis of social groups and of society as a whole.[citation needed]
    <br>This association may be based on inference,[further explanation needed] love, solidarity, support, regular business interactions, or some other type of social connection or commitment. Interpersonal relationships thrive through equitable and reciprocal compromise,[citation needed] they form in the context of social, cultural and other influences.
    <br>The study of interpersonal relationships involves several branches of the social sciences, including such disciplines as sociology, communication studies, psychology, anthropology, and social work.
    <br>Interpersonal ties are also a subject in mathematical sociology.[1]
    <br>The scientific study of relationships evolved during the 1990s and came to be referred to[by whom?] as "relationship science",[2][need quotation to verify] which distinguishes itself from anecdotal evidence or from pseudo-experts by basing conclusions on data and on objective analysis."

    <br>are Dating Sites Successful?
    <br>65% of same-sex couples and 40% of heterosexual couples in the United States who started dating in 2017 met online.
    <br>If you are in a relationship that began in the last decade, it's a good bet you met your mate online. In fact, according to some recent research, online dating has grown from its humble beginnings -- YouTube was originally a dating site that lasted as such for only a few days because no one seemed interested -- to perhaps the most common way of meeting one's match. Reuben J. Thomas of the University of New Mexico and Michael Rosenfeld and Sonia Hausen of Stanford University analyzed findings from several earlier studies and came to the conclusion that dating apps have gained credibility over the years, and that has translated into successful relationships for both gay and straight people. According to their findings, 65 percent of same-sex couples and 39 percent of heterosexual couples who got involved in 2017 met online. “People used to make up stories about how they met, so they wouldn’t have to admit that they met online, but now many people embrace it," Thomas told the website Quartz.

    <br>"How Did Iceland Become a Leader in the Women's Rights Movement?
    <br>On Oct. 24, 1975, 90% of women in Iceland refused to work, either at home or at their jobs, demanding equal rights.
    <br>Sometimes the best way to win a fight is not to fight -- or do anything at all. That lesson was proven perfectly by the women of Iceland on October 24, 1975. Demanding equal rights, the female citizens decided that the ideal method of proving their merit was to show the men what they would be missing, so they stopped working, cooking, cleaning, and even tending to their children. The protest was no small event either, as 90 percent of the country's women joined in. The strike, which included the women taking to the streets, reverberated throughout the nation, with schools, businesses, and nurseries shuttering for the day, and fathers having little choice but to take their kids with them to work. Vigdis Finnbogadottir, who became Iceland's first female president five years after the strike, told the BBC that that single day -- commonly known as "Women's Day Off" -- changed the nation for good. "What happened that day was the first step for women's emancipation in Iceland," she said. "It completely paralyzed the country and opened the eyes of many men."

    <br>Don't make the mistake of respecting grumpy people because they seem to be wise mature people. Grumpiness is fake maturity; it only looks like maturity to the inexperienced.
    <br>Genuinely wise and mature people can express their wisdom without being grumpy about it."

    <br>"An organization, or organisation (Commonwealth English; see spelling differences), is an entity – such as a company, an institution, or an association – comprising one or more people and having a particular purpose.
    <br>The word is derived from the Greek word organon, which means tool or instrument, musical instrument, and organ.
    <br>...what makes an organization an organization is not the paperwork that makes it official but to be an organization there must be four things:
    <br>* A goal in mind
    <br>* A leader or committee making the decision
    <br>* action involved

  <div id="idOznHmnatt001qcvgdsn">description::
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;"Quadratic Voting is a system where each individual is given an equal amount of non-transferable credits. These credits act as a budget to make decisions, where each individual can express the degree of preference based on the number of credits they spend on a vote. Holding a stronger preference will become progressively expensive and in consequence depleting your budget of credits, leaving low or no credits to spend on other decisions.
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr><td># of Votes<td>Cost in Credits
      <tr><td>1<td>1
      <tr><td>2<td>4
      <tr><td>3<td>9
      <tr><td>4<td>16
      <tr><td>n<td>n^2
    </table>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;In other words, it is cheaper to have little influence on many issues but is expensive to have a lot of influence on one issue. Voters will have to prioritize their needs and intentions, they can choose to use a single vote in all issues, or they can exercise their right to apply the degree of preference to the cost of their credits.
    <br>Example:
    <br>Company "X" is about to hold a board member meeting to decide on the budget allocation for the next year. The board consists of 3 members, Alice, Lucy, and Bob. The areas to allocate fundings are Marketing, Development, User Experience, and Legal. Each one of the board members will receive 4 credits, the board members can choose to spend their credits on the areas they believe would be key to grow next year.
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr><td>Board<td>Marketing<td>Development<td>User Experience<td>Legal
      <tr><td>Alice<td>1<td>1<td>1<td>1
      <tr><td>Lucy<td>2<td><td><td>
      <tr><td>Bob<td><td>2<td><td>
    </table>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;In this example, Bob and Lucy applied their degree of preference by voting on the areas they believed the company needed to grow. Whereas Alice, played it safe allocating one single vote on all areas. In this example, Marketing and Development will receive 37.5% each of the allocation budget, and User Experience and Legal will receive 12.5% each.
    <br>This way people get a powerful tool to express their will the way they want: voting for the issues they consider more important and giving those issues a stronger preference."

    <br>"An accounting framework is a published set of criteria that is used to measure, recognize, present, and disclose the information appearing in an entity's financial statements. An organization's financial statements must have been constructed using a recognized framework, or else auditors will not issue a clean audit opinion for them.
    <br>The most commonly-used accounting frameworks are generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and international financial reporting standards (IFRS). GAAP is used by entities in the United States, while IFRS is used in most other parts of the world. These two frameworks are designed to be broad-based and therefore applicable to most types of businesses. There are other accounting frameworks that are designed for special situations, and which are known as other comprehensive bases of accounting (OCBOA)."
    <br>[{2020-11-05} https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/2017/5/7/accounting-framework]
    <br>===
    <br>"An accounting standard is a document issued by a rule-setting body, stating the manner in which accounting transactions are to be recorded and reported. The entities that most commonly issue accounting standards are the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). When an organization follows accounting standards, its financial statements can then be audited by an outside auditor, which is a standard requirement by lenders, creditors, and investors.
    <br>Accounting standards cover a broad range of topics, including the following:
    <br>* General principles
    <br>* Presentation
    <br>* Assets

    <br>"IFRS is short for International Financial Reporting Standards. IFRS is the international accounting framework within which to properly organize and report financial information. It is derived from the pronouncements of the London-based International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). It is currently the required accounting framework in more than 120 countries. IFRS requires businesses to report their financial results and financial position using the same rules; this means that, barring any fraudulent manipulation, there is considerable uniformity in the financial reporting of all businesses using IFRS, which makes it easier to compare and contrast their financial results.
    <br>IFRS is used primarily by businesses reporting their financial results anywhere in the world except the United States. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, is the accounting framework used in the United States. GAAP is much more rules-based than IFRS. IFRS focuses more on general principles than GAAP, which makes the IFRS body of work much smaller, cleaner, and easier to understand than GAAP.
    <br>IFRS covers a broad array of topics, including:
    <br>* Presentation of financial statements
    <br>* Revenue recognition
    <br>* Employee benefits
    <br>* Borrowing costs
    <br>* Income taxes
    <br>* Investment in associates
    <br>* Inventories
    <br>* Fixed assets
    <br>* Intangible assets
    <br>* Leases
    <br>* Retirement benefit plans
    <br>* Business combinations
    <br>* Foreign exchange rates
    <br>* Operating segments
    <br>* Subsequent events
    <br>Industry-specific accounting, such as mineral resources and agriculture
    <br>There are several working groups that are gradually reducing the differences between the GAAP and IFRS accounting frameworks, so eventually there should be minor differences in the reported results of a business if it switches between the two frameworks. There is a stated intent to eventually merge GAAP into IFRS, but this has not yet occurred.
    <br>There will be a reduced cost for companies once the two accounting frameworks are more closely aligned, since they will not have to pay to have their financial statements restated to show results under the other framework in cases where they need to report their results in locations where the other framework is required."

    <br>"GAAP is short for Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. GAAP is a cluster of accounting standards and common industry usage that have been developed over many years. It is used by organizations to:
    <br>* Properly organize their financial information into accounting records;
    <br>* Summarize the accounting records into financial statements; and
    <br>* Disclose certain supporting information.
    <br>One of the reasons for using GAAP is so that anyone reading the financial statements of multiple companies has a reasonable basis for comparison, since all companies using GAAP have created their financial statements using the same set of rules.
    <br>Sources of GAAP
    <br>GAAP is derived from the pronouncements of a series of government-sponsored accounting entities, of which the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is the latest. The Securities and Exchange Commission also issues accounting pronouncements through its Accounting Staff Bulletins and other announcements that are applicable only to publicly-held companies, and which are considered to be part of GAAP. GAAP is codified into the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), which is available online and (more legibly) in printed form.
    <br>GAAP Topics
    <br>GAAP covers a broad array of topics, including the following:
    <br>* Financial statement presentation
    <br>* Assets
    <br>* Liabilities
    <br>* Equity
    <br>* Revenue
    <br>* Expenses
    <br>* Business combinations
    <br>* Derivatives and hedging
    <br>* Fair value
    <br>* Foreign currency
    <br>* Leases
    <br>* Nonmonetary transactions
    <br>* Subsequent events
    <br>Industry-specific accounting, such as airlines, extractive activities, and health care
    <br>The industry-specific accounting that is allowed or required under GAAP may vary substantially from the more generic standards for certain accounting transactions.
    <br>Users of GAAP
    <br>GAAP is used primarily by businesses reporting their financial results in the United States. International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS, is the accounting framework used in most other countries. GAAP is much more rules-based than IFRS. IFRS focuses more on general principles than GAAP, which makes the IFRS body of work much smaller, cleaner, and easier to understand than GAAP. Since IFRS is still being constructed, GAAP is considered to be the more comprehensive accounting framework.
    <br>GAAP Convergence with IFRS
    <br>There are several working groups that are gradually reducing the differences between the GAAP and IFRS accounting frameworks, so eventually there should be minor differences in the reported results of a business if it switches between the two. There is a stated intent to eventually merge GAAP into IFRS, but this has not yet occurred. Given recent differences of opinion arising during several joint projects, it is possible that the frameworks will never be merged."

    <br>"Financial statements (or financial reports) are formal records of the financial activities and position of a business, person, or other entity.
    <br>Relevant financial information is presented in a structured manner and in a form which is easy to understand. They typically include four basic financial statements accompanied by a management discussion and analysis:[1]
    <br>* A balance sheet or statement of financial position, reports on a company's assets, liabilities, and owners equity at a given point in time.
    <br>* An income statement—or profit and loss report (P&L report), or statement of comprehensive income, or statement of revenue & expense—reports on a company's income, expenses, and profits over a stated period. A profit and loss statement provides information on the operation of the enterprise. These include sales and the various expenses incurred during the stated period.
    <br>* A statement of changes in equity or statement of equity, or statement of retained earnings, reports on the changes in equity of the company over a stated period.
    <br>* A cash flow statement reports on a company's cash flow activities, particularly its operating, investing and financing activities over a stated period.
    <br>* A comprehensive income statement involves those other comprehensive income items which are not included while determining net income.
    <br>(Notably, a balance sheet represents a single point in time, where the income statement, the statement of changes in equity, and the cash flow statement each represent activities over a stated period.)
    <br>For large corporations, these statements may be complex and may include an extensive set of footnotes to the financial statements and management discussion and analysis. The notes typically describe each item on the balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement in further detail. Notes to financial statements are considered an integral part of the financial statements."

  <h3 id="idOznHmnatt030H3">accounting-vs-bookkeeping of ozn
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idOznHmnatt030H3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idOznHmnatt030dsn">description::
    <br>"What Is Bookkeeping?
    <br>Bookkeeping is a crucial first step in the accounting process. Think of bookkeepers as athletes who start the track relay. They lay the foundation for accountants by recording financial transactions. Once the first leg of the race is finished, they hand over the batons—the financial information contained in ledgers and journals—to accountants to complete the race. (That’s not to say that accountants can’t and won’t record transactions—they can and often will. This analogy simply illustrates the differences in roles).
    <br>By recording transactions, bookkeepers track your finances so you can view at a glance how much money is entering and leaving your business. And because they’re tax compliant, you can feel confident they’ll keep you on the straight and narrow.
    <br>But what exactly are some of the tasks bookkeepers do? Here are six common bookkeeping tasks:
    <br>1. Recording income from services as well as expenses such as rent, utilities and office supplies
    <br>2. Managing payroll, though this is not a core bookkeeping function
    <br>3. Creating invoices and making payments for you—this depends on your specific arrangement with them
    <br>4. Comparing the balances in your books against bank transactions to see if they match. If not, they make adjustments and create bank reconciliation statements to record these discrepancies.
    <br>5. Tracking accounts payable (money you owe) and accounts receivable (money owed to you). Bookkeepers keep tabs on all invoices and due dates and follow up with late payers. They will also make sure that you pay your accounts on time and don’t pay twice. As soon as the payment is made they will record the amount as a business expense in the ledger.
    <br>6. Maintaining the general ledger, which is the master accounting document that stores all your financial transactions. The general ledger typically uses the double-entry accounting method, meaning for every debit on one account there’s a corresponding credit on another. Your bookkeeper will:
    <br>* Post relevant credit and debits to your journal before transferring it over to the general ledger
    <br>* Ensure these debits and credits balance
    <br>* Record all income and expenses in this way
    <br>What Is Accounting?
    <br>The accountant will now use the recorded data to interpret, analyze and report on the financial health of the business. Because they offer more detailed insights that inform business decisions, you wouldn’t want to hire an accountant to only record income and expenses. You’d pay more for the same service a bookkeeper could do for less, and in the process, underutilize the accountant’s expertise. Here are four tasks that an accountant performs:
    <br>1. Preparing financial statements to help you see the bigger picture and assess the financial health of your business, including:
    <br>* Balance sheets: A snapshot of your financial situation at a point in time, calculated through this formula: Assets = Equity – Liabilities
    <br>* Income statements: A record of all your income and expenses over a period of time
    <br>* Cash flow statement: A record of cash flowing in and out of your business for a period of time
    <br>2. Analyzing journals and ledger entries, and making adjustments, e.g., accountants will identify any incurred expenses that have not yet been recorded
    <br>3. Providing tax advice and completing and filing tax returns
    <br>4. Offering financial advice and helping understand the consequences of your financial decisions"

    <br>"A tax is a compulsory financial charge or some other type of levy imposed on a taxpayer (an individual or legal entity) by a governmental organization in order to fund government spending and various public expenditures.[2] A failure to pay, along with evasion of or resistance to taxation, is punishable by law. Taxes consist of direct or indirect taxes and may be paid in money or as its labour equivalent. The first known taxation took place in Ancient Egypt around 3000–2800 BC.
    <br>Most countries have a tax system in place to pay for public, common, or agreed national needs and government functions. Some levy a flat percentage rate of taxation on personal annual income, but most scale taxes based on annual income amounts. Most countries charge a tax on an individual's income as well as on corporate income. Countries or subunits often also impose wealth taxes, inheritance taxes, estate taxes, gift taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, payroll taxes or tariffs.
    <br>In economic terms, taxation transfers wealth from households or businesses to the government. This has effects which can both increase and reduce economic growth and economic welfare. Consequently, taxation is a highly debated topic."

    <br>"Organizational theory consists of many approaches to organizational analysis. "Organizations" are defined as social units of people that are structured and managed to meet a need, or to pursue collective goals. Theories of organizations include rational system perspective, division of labor, bureaucratic theory, and contingency theory.
    <br>In a rational organization system, there are two significant parts: Specificity of Goals and Formalization. The division of labor is the specialization of individual labor roles, associated with increasing output and trade. Modernization theorist Frank Dobbin states that "modern institutions are transparently purposive and that we are in the midst of an evolutionary progression towards more efficient forms." Max Weber's conception of bureaucracy is characterized by the presence of impersonal positions that are earned and not inherited, rule-governed decision-making, professionalism, chain of command, defined responsibility, and bounded authority. The contingency theory holds that an organization must try to maximize performance by minimizing the effects of varying environmental and internal constraints.
    <br>As noted by Dwight Waldo in a review of field work in 1978, "Organization theory is characterized by vogues, heterogeneity, claims and counterclaims;"[1] even greater differentiation in theory and practice have developed since then. Organization theory cannot be described as an orderly progression of ideas, or a unified body of knowledge in which each development builds carefully on and extends the one before it. Rather, developments in theory and prescriptions for practice show disagreement about the purposes and uses of a theory of organization, the issues to which it should address itself (such as supervisory style and organizational culture), and the concepts and variables that should enter into such a theory."

    <br>"Management science (MS) is the broad interdisciplinary study of problem solving and decision making in human organizations, with strong links to management, economics, business, engineering, management consulting, and other fields. It uses various scientific research-based principles, strategies, and analytical methods including mathematical modeling, statistics and numerical algorithms to improve an organization's ability to enact rational and accurate management decisions by arriving at optimal or near optimal solutions to complex decision problems. Management science helps businesses to achieve goals using various scientific methods.
    <br>The field was initially an outgrowth of applied mathematics, where early challenges were problems relating to the optimization of systems which could be modeled linearly, i.e., determining the optima (maximum value of profit, assembly line performance, crop yield, bandwidth, etc. or minimum of loss, risk, costs, etc.) of some objective function. Today, management science encompasses any organizational activity for which a problem is structured in mathematical form to generate managerially relevant insights."

    <br>"Organizational analysis or more commonly Industrial analysis is the process of reviewing the development, work environment, personnel, and operation of a business or another type of association.[1] This review is often performed in response to crisis, but may also be carried out as part of a demonstration project, in the process of taking a program to scale, or in the course of regular operations. Conducting a periodic detailed organizational analysis can be a useful way for management to identify problems or inefficiencies that have arisen in the organization but have yet to be addressed, and develop strategies for resolving them.[1]
    <br>Organizational analysis focuses on the structure and design of the organization and how the organization's systems, capacity and functionality influence outputs. Additional internal and external factors are also accounted for in assessing how to improve efficiency. Undertaking an organizational analysis is helpful in assessing an organization's current well-being and capacity, and deciding on a course of action to improve the organization's long-term sustainability. A restructuring of an Organization may become necessary when either external or internal forces have created a problem or opportunity for improvement in efficiency and effectiveness.
    <br>When performing an organizational analysis, many details emerge about the functions and capacity of the organization. All of these details can make pinpointing what is efficient and inefficient difficult. Using theoretical organizational models can help sort out the information, and make it easier to draw connections. After working through these theoretical models, the organizations present situation is more adequately addressed, and the trajectory of the organization can be more fully determined."

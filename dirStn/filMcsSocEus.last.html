    <br>"The feature that is completely new in the EU and distinguishes it from the usual type of international association of states is that the Member States have ceded some of their sovereign rights to the EU and have conferred on the Union powers to act independently.
    <br>In exercising these powers, the EU is able to adopt European legislation which has the same force as national laws in individual states."

    <br>"However, the EU is not merely a creation of law but also pursues its objectives purely by means of law. It is a Union based on law. The common economic and social life of the peoples of the Member States is governed not by the threat of force but by the law of the Union. This is the basis of the institutional system. It lays down the procedure for decision-making by the Union institutions and regulates their relationship to each other. It provides the institutions with the means — in the shape of regulations, directives and decisions — of enacting legal instruments binding on the Member States and their citizens. Thus the individuals themselves become a main focus of the Union. Its legal order directly affects their daily life to an ever-increasing extent. It accords them rights and imposes obligations on them, so that as citizens both of their state and of the Union they are governed by a hierarchy of legal orders — a phenomenon familiar from federal constitutions.

    <br>The EU is home to over 60 indigenous regional or minority languages, spoken by some 40 million people. They include Basque, Catalan, Frisian, Saami and Yiddish.
    <br>The European Commission maintains an open dialogue, encouraging linguistic diversity and putting effort into preserving this heritage. But the legal status of these languages and the extent to which they receive support is determined by national governments.
    <br>One significant source of funds for initiatives to protect and promote the teaching and learning of minority languages is Erasmus+, an EU programme that encompasses education and training."

    <br>"History of the European Council President function
    <br>The position of President of the European Council became a permanent and full-time role following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009.
    <br>Previously, the European Council had been an informal body and the head of the European Council was an unofficial position. The role was held by the head of state or government of the member state holding the rotating Presidency of the Council of the EU.
    <br>...
    <br>The role of the President is set out in article 15 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU). In particular, the President of the European Council is responsible for:
    <br>* chairing European Council meetings and driving forward its work
    <br>* ensuring the preparation of European Council meetings and the continuity of their work, in cooperation with the President of the Commission, and on the basis of the work of the General Affairs Council configuration
    <br>* helping to facilitate cohesion and consensus within the European Council
    <br>* presenting a report to the European Parliament after each European Council meeting
    <br>The President of the European Council also ensures the external representation of the EU at the level of heads of state or government:
    <br>* on issues related to the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), alongside the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy who helps put into effect the CFSP and ensure its unity, consistency and effectiveness
    <br>* at international summits, usually alongside the President of the European Commission"

    <br>"Since the establishment of the Court of Justice of the European Union in 1952, its mission has been to ensure that "the law is observed" "in the interpretation and application" of the Treaties.
    <br>As part of that mission, the Court of Justice of the European Union:
    <br>* reviews the legality of the acts of the institutions of the European Union,
    <br>* ensures that the Member States comply with obligations under the Treaties, and
    <br>* interprets European Union law at the request of the national courts and tribunals.
    <br>The Court thus constitutes the judicial authority of the European Union and, in cooperation with the courts and tribunals of the Member States, it ensures the uniform application and interpretation of EU law.
    <br>The Court of Justice of the European Union, which has its seat in Luxembourg, consists of two courts: the Court of Justice and the General Court (created in 1988). The Civil Service Tribunal, established in 2004, ceased to operate on 1 September 2016 after its jurisdiction was transferred to the General Court in the context of the reform of the European Union’s judicial structure.
    <br>As each Member State has its own language and specific legal system, the Court of Justice of the European Union is a multilingual institution. Its language arrangements have no equivalent in any other court in the world, since each of the official languages of the European Union can be the language of a case. The Court is required to observe the principle of multilingualism in full, because of the need to communicate with the parties in the language of the proceedings and to ensure that its case-law is disseminated throughout the Member States."

    <br>"The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) (French: Cour de justice de l'Union europιenne or "CJUE"; Latin: Curia[2]) is the judicial branch of the European Union (EU). Seated in the Kirchberg quarter of Luxembourg City, Luxembourg, this EU institution consists of two separate courts: the Court of Justice and the General Court.[3][4] From 2005 to 2016 it also consisted of the Civil Service Tribunal. It has a sui generis court system, meaning ’of its own kind’, and is a supranational institution.[5]
    <br>CJEU is the chief judicial authority of the European Union and oversees the uniform application and interpretation of European Union law, in co-operation with the national judiciary of the member states.[4] CJEU also resolves legal disputes between national governments and EU institutions, and may take action against EU institutions on behalf of individuals, companies or organisations whose rights have been infringed.[6]"

    <br>"The European Court of Justice (ECJ, French: Cour de Justice europιenne), formally just the Court of Justice, is the supreme court of the European Union in matters of European Union law. As a part of the Court of Justice of the European Union, it is tasked with interpreting EU law and ensuring its equal application across all EU member states under Article 263 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).[2]
    <br>The Court was established in 1952, and is based in Luxembourg. It is composed of one judge per member state – currently 27 – although it normally hears cases in panels of three, five or fifteen judges.[3] The Court has been led by president Koen Lenaerts since 2015.[2]"

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idSocEusatt014H3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idSocEusatt014dsn">description::
    <br>"Composition
    <br>The General Court is made up of two judges from each Member State. The judges are appointed by common accord of the governments of the Member States after consultation of a panel responsible for giving an opinion on candidates' suitability to perform the duties of Judge. Their term of office is six years, and is renewable. They appoint their President, for a period of three years, from amongst themselves. They appoint a Registrar for a term of office of six years.
    <br>The Judges perform their duties in a totally impartial and independent manner.
    <br>Unlike the Court of Justice, the General Court does not have permanent Advocates General. However, that task may, in exceptional circumstances, be carried out by a Judge.
    <br>Cases before the General Court are heard by Chambers of five or three Judges or, in some cases, as a single Judge. It may also sit as a Grand Chamber (fifteen Judges) when this is justified by the legal complexity or importance of the case.
    <br>The Presidents of the Chambers of five Judges are elected from amongst the Judges for a period of three years.
    <br>The General Court has its own Registry, but uses the administrative and linguistic services of the institution for its other requirements.
    <br>Jurisdiction
    <br>The General Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine:
    <br>* actions brought by natural or legal persons against acts of the institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the European Union (which are addressed to them or are of direct and individual concern to them) and against regulatory acts (which concern them directly and which do not entail implementing measures) or against a failure to act on the part of those institutions, bodies, offices or agencies; for example, a case brought by a company against a Commission decision imposing a fine on that company;
    <br>* actions brought by the Member States against the Commission;
    <br>* actions brought by the Member States against the Council relating to acts adopted in the field of State aid, trade protection measures (dumping) and acts by which it exercises implementing powers;
    <br>* actions seeking compensation for damage caused by the institutions or the bodies, offices or agencies of the European Union or their staff;
    <br>* actions based on contracts made by the European Union which expressly give jurisdiction to the General Court;
    <br>* actions relating to intellectual property brought against the European Union Intellectual Property Office and against the Community Plant Variety Office;
    <br>* disputes between the institutions of the European Union and their staff concerning employment relations and the social security system.
    <br>The decisions of the General Court may, within two months, be subject to an appeal before the Court of Justice, limited to points of law."

  <p id="idSocEusatt015dsn">description::
    <br>"The Judicial Network of the European Union (Rιseau judiciaire de l’Union europιenne, ‘RJUE’) was created on the initiative of the President of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Presidents of the Constitutional and Supreme Courts of the Member States on the occasion of the Meeting of Judges organised by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on 27 March 2017 to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Treaties of Rome.
    <br>The discussions, inspired by a common interest in the strengthening of judicial cooperation in Europe at the service of high-quality justice, led, as early as January 2018, to the creation of a secure exchange platform for member courts of the RJUE, the first specific manifestation of that cooperation. In view of the considerable interest of the information provided via this platform for the development and consistency of EU law, the Court of Justice of the European Union and the participating courts have chosen, in a second step, to share all non-confidential documents with the general public by opening an area dedicated to the RJUE on the Curia website.
    <br>The main objective of this area is to share and centralise information and documents relevant to the application, dissemination and study of EU law, as interpreted and applied not only by the Court of Justice of the European Union but also by national courts and tribunals. It also aims to promote mutual knowledge and understanding of the laws and systems of the Member States from a comparative law perspective that can facilitate consideration of the legal traditions of each Member State.
    <br>To this end, the RJUE area provides:
    <br>* direct access to preliminary rulings (by means of pre-defined search criteria in the search engine) and, in particular, an opportunity to consult references for a preliminary ruling submitted from 1 July 2018, in the language of the case, but also in all available languages;
    <br>* an opportunity to consult decisions of national courts and tribunals which have been selected by the Constitutional and Supreme Courts of the Member States because of their interest for EU law;
    <br>* an opportunity to consult various documents of a scientific or educational nature, resulting from research or monitoring work carried out by the member courts of the RJUE, whether these are notes or studies, fact sheets on case-law concerning EU law or legal monitoring tools."

    <br>A new advisory body was set up alongside the Economic and Social Committee by the TEU (Treaty of Maastricht): the Committee of the Regions. Like the European Economic and Social Committee, it is not strictly an EU institution, as its function is purely advisory. It is not its task to produce legally binding decisions in the same way as the fully fledged EU institutions (European Parliament, European Council, Council of the European Union, European Commission, CJEU, ECB, European Court of Auditors).
    <br>Like the Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions consists of 350 members. The members are representatives of regional and local authorities in the Member States who must have a mandate based on elections from the authorities they represent, or must be politically accountable to them.
    <br>There are a number of areas in which consultation by the Council of the European Union or the Commission is required (‘mandatory consultation’): education; culture; public health; trans-European networks; transport, telecommunications and energy infrastructure; economic and social cohesion; employment policy and social legislation. The Council also consults the Committee of the Regions regularly, and without any legal obligation, in connection with a wide range of draft legislation (‘non-mandatory consultation’)."

    <br>The European System of Central Banks is composed of the ECB and of the central banks of the Member States (Article 129 TFEU). It has the task of defining and implementing the monetary policy of the Union, and has the exclusive right to authorise the issue of banknotes and coins within the Union. It also manages the official currency reserves of the Member States and ensures the smooth operation of payments systems (Article 127(2) TFEU)."

    <br>"The Court of Auditors (Articles 285 and 286 TFEU)
    <br>The Court of Auditors was set up on 22 July 1975 and began work in Luxembourg in October 1977. It has since risen to the rank of Union institution (Article 13 TEU). It consists of 28 members, corresponding to the present number of Member States. They are appointed for 6 years by the Council, which approves, by qualified majority and following consultation with the European Parliament, a list of members drawn up in accordance with proposals from the Member States (Article 286(2) TFEU). The members elect the President of the Court of Auditors from among their number for a term of 3 years; the President may be re-elected.
    <br>The Court of Auditors’ task is to examine whether all revenue has been received and all expenditure incurred in a lawful and regular manner and whether financial management has been sound. The chief weapon in its armoury is the fact that it can publicise its findings. The results of its investigations are summarised in an annual report at the end of each financial year, which is published in the Official Journal of the European Union and thus brought to public attention. It may also make special reports at any time on specific areas of financial management, and these are also published in the Official Journal."

The High Representative has a base in both the Council, where they hold the presidency of the Foreign Affairs Council, and the Commission, where they are Vice-President in charge of foreign affairs. The High Representative is appointed by the European Council, acting by a qualified majority, with the agreement of the President of the Commission. He or she is assisted by a European External Action Service (EEAS), which was newly created in 2011 and was formed by a merger of the foreign policy departments of the Commission and the Council and the integration of diplomats from the national diplomatic services."

    <br>"This naturally begs the question of where the dividing line is between EU competencies and those of the Member States. This dividing line is drawn on the basis of the following three categories of competence.
    <br>* Exclusive competence of the EU (Article 3 TFEU) in areas where it can be assumed that a measure at EU level will be more effective than a measure in any Member State that is not coordinated. These areas are clearly set out and comprise the customs union, the establishing of the competition rules necessary for the functioning of the internal market, the monetary policy of the euro states, the common commercial policy and parts of the common fisheries policy. In these policy areas only the EU may legislate and adopt legally binding acts, the Member States being able to do so themselves only if so empowered by the EU or for the implementation of Union acts (Article 2(1) TFEU).
    <br>* Shared competence between the EU and the Member States (Article 4 TFEU) in areas where action at Union level will add value over action by Member States. There is shared competence for internal market rules, economic, social and territorial cohesion, agriculture and fisheries, environment, transport, trans-European networks, energy supply and the area of freedom, security and justice, and also for common safety concerns in public health matters, research and technological development, space, development cooperation and humanitarian aid. In all these areas the EU can exercise competence first, but only with regard to matters laid down in the relevant Union instrument and not to the entire policy area. The Member States exercise their competence to the extent that the EU has not exercised, or has decided to cease exercising, its competence (Article 2(2) TFEU). The latter situation arises when the relevant EU institutions decide to repeal a legislative act, in particular to respect the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. The Council may, on the initiative of one or more of its members, request that the Commission submit proposals for repealing a legislative act.
    <br>* Competence to carry out supporting action (Article 6 TFEU). The EU’s competence to carry out supporting action is limited to coordinating or providing complementary action for the action of the Member States; the EU cannot harmonise national law in the areas concerned (Article 2(5) TFEU). Responsibility for drafting legislation therefore continues to lie with the Member States, which thus have considerable freedom to act. The areas covered by this category of competence are protection and improvement of human health, industry, culture, tourism, education, youth, sport and vocational training, civil protection and administrative cooperation. In the areas of employment and economic policy, the Member States explicitly acknowledge the need to coordinate national measures within the EU."

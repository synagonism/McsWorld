    <br>"Sign languages (also known as signed languages) are languages that use the visual-manual modality to convey meaning. Sign languages are expressed through manual articulations in combination with non-manual elements. Sign languages are full-fledged natural languages with their own grammar and lexicon.[1] Sign languages are not universal and are usually not mutually intelligible with each other,[2] although there are also similarities among different sign languages.
    <br>Linguists consider both spoken and signed communication to be types of natural language, meaning that both emerged through an abstract, protracted aging process and evolved over time without meticulous planning.[3] Sign language should not be confused with body language, a type of nonverbal communication."

    <br>"Research has found strong support for the idea that verbal language and sign language depend on similar neural structures. Patients who used sign language, and who suffered from a left-hemisphere lesion, showed the same disorders with their sign language as vocal patients did with their oral language.[88] Other researchers found that the same left-hemisphere brain regions were active during sign language as during the use of vocal or written language.[89]"

    <br>"sign language parts of speech
    <br>Sign language, like spoken languages, has parts of speech that are used to categorize words based on their grammatical function within a sentence. The following are the parts of speech in sign language:
    <br>1. Nouns: These are words that represent people, places, things, and ideas. In sign language, nouns are often represented by a sign that indicates the object being referred to.
    <br>2. Verbs: These are words that describe an action, occurrence, or state of being. In sign language, verbs are often indicated by movement and the placement of the hands.
    <br>3. Adjectives: These are words that describe a noun, such as its color, size, or shape. In sign language, adjectives are indicated by the use of classifiers, which are handshapes that represent the characteristics of the noun being described.
    <br>4. Adverbs: These are words that describe or modify a verb, adjective, or another adverb. In sign language, adverbs are indicated by the movement and placement of the hands.
    <br>5. Pronouns: These are words that take the place of a noun, such as "he," "she," or "they." In sign language, pronouns are indicated by pointing or other handshapes that represent the person or group being referred to.
    <br>6. Prepositions: These are words that show the relationship between a noun or pronoun and other words in a sentence, such as "on," "in," or "through." In sign language, prepositions are indicated by the movement and placement of the hands.
    <br>7. Conjunctions: These are words that connect words or groups of words in a sentence, such as "and," "but," or "or." In sign language, conjunctions are indicated by the movement and placement of the hands.
    <br>8. Interjections: These are words or phrases that express strong emotion or surprise, such as "wow" or "ouch." In sign language, interjections are indicated by the facial expressions and movements of the hands."

    <br>"Sign languages generally do not have any linguistic relation to the spoken languages of the lands in which they arise. The correlation between sign and spoken languages is complex and varies depending on the country more than the spoken language. For example, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the US all have English as their dominant language, but American Sign Language (ASL), used in the US and English-speaking Canada, is derived from French Sign Language[23] whereas the other three countries use varieties of British, Australian and New Zealand Sign Language, which is unrelated to ASL.[24] Similarly, the sign languages of Spain and Mexico are very different, despite Spanish being the national language in each country,[25] and the sign language used in Bolivia is based on ASL rather than any sign language that is used in any other Spanish-speaking country.[26] Variations also arise within a 'national' sign language which do not necessarily correspond to dialect differences in the national spoken language; rather, they can usually be correlated to the geographic location of residential schools for the deaf.[27][28]"

    <br>"AI programs can become biased after learning from real-world data. It is not typically introduced by the system designers but is learned by the program, and thus the programmers are often unaware that the bias exists.[204] Bias can be inadvertently introduced by the way training data is selected.[205] It can also emerge from correlations: AI is used to classify individuals into groups and then make predictions assuming that the individual will resemble other members of the group. In some cases, this assumption may be unfair.[206] An example of this is COMPAS, a commercial program widely used by U.S. courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist. ProPublica claims that the COMPAS-assigned recidivism risk level of black defendants is far more likely to be overestimated than that of white defendants, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants.[207]"

  <p id="idTechAiuelmtdsn">description::
    <br>"In the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that "we're in uncharted territory" with AI.[195] A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment, but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed.[196] Subjective estimates of the risk vary widely; for example, Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimate 47% of U.S. jobs are at "high risk" of potential automation, while an OECD report classifies only 9% of U.S. jobs as "high risk".[t][198]
    <br>Unlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; The Economist states that "the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution" is "worth taking seriously".[199] Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.[200]"

  <p id="idTechAiexlrdsn">description::
    <br>"Existential risk from artificial general intelligence is the hypothesis that substantial progress in artificial general intelligence (AGI) could result in human extinction or some other unrecoverable global catastrophe.[1][2][3]
    <br>The existential risk ("x-risk") school argues as follows: The human species currently dominates other species because the human brain has some distinctive capabilities that other animals lack. If AI surpasses humanity in general intelligence and becomes "superintelligent", then it could become difficult or impossible for humans to control. Just as the fate of the mountain gorilla depends on human goodwill, so might the fate of humanity depend on the actions of a future machine superintelligence.[4]
    <br>The probability of this type of scenario is widely debated, and hinges in part on differing scenarios for future progress in computer science.[5] Concerns about superintelligence have been voiced by leading computer scientists and tech CEOs such as Geoffrey Hinton,[6] Alan Turing,[a] Elon Musk,[9] and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.[10] As of 2022, circa half of AI researchers believe that there is a 10 percent or greater chance that our inability to control AI will cause an existential catastrophe.[11][12]"

    <br>"The regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating artificial intelligence (AI); it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms. The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally, including in the European Union and in supra-national bodies like the IEEE, OECD and others. Since 2016, a wave of AI ethics guidelines have been published in order to maintain social control over the technology.[1] Regulation is considered necessary to both encourage AI and manage associated risks. In addition to regulation, AI-deploying organizations need to play a central role in creating and deploying trustworthy AI in line with the principles of trustworthy AI,[2] and take accountability to mitigate the risks.[3] Regulation of AI through mechanisms such as review boards can also be seen as social means to approach the AI control problem.[4][5]"

Emboldened by the success of the Allen Institute for Brain Science, Paul wanted to launch an independent inquiry into the nature of the mind based on AI. In essence, he decided to hedge his bets as to whether neuroscience or AI (or both) would yield breakthrough insights into the nature of intelligence.
    <br>... Today AI2 employs over 200 researchers, engineers, and support staff over multiple sites, and is recognized worldwide as a premiere AI research organization. Its research scope has grown, adding new programs in computer vision and perception (PRIOR), commonsense reasoning (Mosaic), natural language processing (AllenNLP), and most recently AI for the Environment, as well as launching a new branch in Israel (AI2 Israel). Most importantly, AI2 has produced, and continues to produce, many high-impact results that have significantly altered the course of the field, described throughout this book. Paul Allen was the visionary who created AI2 and had the courage to turn his AI dreams into a reality, and until his tragic passing in 2018 he keenly followed our work and regularly challenged us all to strive for breakthroughs. The research collected here summarizes many of our important results to date, and I think he would be proud. But then he would immediately follow that with his characteristic, relentless push forward, reflective of a true visionary: "So what's next?""

  <p id="idTechAievgwntrdsn">description::
    <br>"In the history of artificial intelligence, an AI winter is a period of reduced funding and interest in artificial intelligence research.[1] The term was coined by analogy to the idea of a nuclear winter.[2] The field has experienced several hype cycles, followed by disappointment and criticism, followed by funding cuts, followed by renewed interest years or even decades later.
    <br>The term first appeared in 1984 as the topic of a public debate at the annual meeting of AAAI (then called the "American Association of Artificial Intelligence"). It is a chain reaction that begins with pessimism in the AI community, followed by pessimism in the press, followed by a severe cutback in funding, followed by the end of serious research.[2] At the meeting, Roger Schank and Marvin Minsky—two leading AI researchers who had survived the "winter" of the 1970s—warned the business community that enthusiasm for AI had spiraled out of control in the 1980s and that disappointment would certainly follow. Three years later, the billion-dollar AI industry began to collapse.[2]
    <br>Hype is common in many emerging technologies, such as the railway mania or the dot-com bubble. The AI winter was a result of such hype, due to over-inflated promises by developers, unnaturally high expectations from end-users, and extensive promotion in the media.[3] Despite the rise and fall of AI's reputation, it has continued to develop new and successful technologies. AI researcher Rodney Brooks would complain in 2002 that "there's this stupid myth out there that AI has failed, but AI is around you every second of the day."[4] In 2005, Ray Kurzweil agreed: "Many observers still think that the AI winter was the end of the story and that nothing since has come of the AI field. Yet today many thousands of AI applications are deeply embedded in the infrastructure of every industry."[5]
    <br>Enthusiasm and optimism about AI has generally increased since its low point in the early 1990s. Beginning about 2012, interest in artificial intelligence (and especially the sub-field of machine learning) from the research and corporate communities led to a dramatic increase in funding and investment."

    <br>"Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) is defined as “any intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest” (Bostrom 2016). ASI is supposed to surpass human intelligence in all aspects — such as creativity, general wisdom, and problem-solving. ASI is supposed to be capable of exhibiting intelligence that we have not seen in the brightest thinkers amongst us. Many thinkers are worried about ASI. At this moment, ASI belongs to science fiction.
    <br>If we ever succeed in creating an AI that is capable of generalizing, understanding causality, making a model of the world, it is highly likely that it will be closer to ASI than AGI. AI excels in numerical calculations, and there is no logical explanation as to why AI would downgrade its abilities to simulate humans. AI’s quest ultimately leads to ASI."

    <br>"Semantic AI is used everywhere where the complexity of the underlying data is high and the details must not be ignored.
    <br>This distinguishes semantic AI from AI based on statistical methods (e.g. neural networks): statistical AI generalizes but details and traceability are lost. This is not bad for the classification of images - but not acceptable for the representation of processes or contracts."
    <br>[{2021-02-04} https://www.semafora-systems.com/]
    <br>"Historically, there have been two dominant paradigms of AI, namely symbolism and connectionism. Symbolism conjectures that symbols representing things in the world are the fundamental units of human intelligence, and that the cognitive process can be accomplished by the manipulation of the symbols, through a series of rules and logic operations upon the symbolic representations [2], [3]. Many early AI systems, from the middle 1950s to the late 1980s, were built upon symbolistic models. Symbolic methods have several virtues: they require only a few input samples, use powerful declarative languages for knowledge representation, and have conceptually straightforward internal functionality. It soon became apparent, however, that such a rule-based, top-down strategy demands substantial hand-tuning and lacks true learning. As discrete symbolic representations and hand-crafted rules are intolerant of ambiguous and noisy data, symbolic approaches typically fall short when solving real-world problems."

    <br>"Connectionism, known by its most successful technique, deep neural networks (DNNs) [4], serves as the architecture behind the vast majority of recent successful AI systems. Inspired by the physiology of the nervous system, connectionism explains cognition by interconnected networks of simple and often uniform units. Learning happens as weight modification, in a data-driven manner; the network weights are adjusted in the direction that minimises the cumulative error from all the training samples, using techniques such as gradient back-propagation [5]. Connectionist models are fault-tolerant, as they learn sub-symbolics, i.e., continuous embedding vectors, and compare these vectorized representations instead of the literal meaning between entities and relations by discrete symbolic representations. Moreover, by learning statistical patterns from data, connectionist models enjoy the advantages of inductive learning and generalization capabilities. Like every coin has two sides, such approaches also suffer from several fundamental problems [6], [7]. First, connectionist models fall significantly short of compositional generalization, the robust ability of human cognition to correctly solve any problem that is composed of familiar parts [8]. Second, such bottom-up approaches are known to be data inefficient. Third, connectionist models are logically opaque, lacking comprehensibility. It is almost impossible to understand why decisions are made. In the absence of any kind of identifiable or verifiable train of logic, people are left with systems that are making potentially catastrophic decisions that are difficult to understand, arduous to correct, and therefore hard to be trusted. These shortcomings hinder the adoption of connectionist systems in decision-critical applications and reasoning-heavy tasks, such as medical diagnosis, autonomous driving, and mathematical reasoning, and lead to the increasing concern about contemporary AI techniques."

    <br>"By the 1950s, two visions for how to achieve machine intelligence emerged. One vision, known as Symbolic AI or GOFAI, was to use computers to create a symbolic representation of the world and systems that could reason about the world. Proponents included Allen Newell, Herbert A. Simon, and Marvin Minsky. Closely associated with this approach was the "heuristic search" approach, which likened intelligence to a problem of exploring a space of possibilities for answers.
    <br>The second vision, known as the connectionist approach, sought to achieve intelligence through learning. Proponents of this approach, most prominently Frank Rosenblatt, sought to connect Perceptron in ways inspired by connections of neurons.[21] <span class="clsColorRed">James Manyika and others have compared the two approaches to the mind (Symbolic AI) and the brain (connectionist)</span>. Manyika argues that symbolic approaches dominated the push for artificial intelligence in this period, due in part to its connection to intellectual traditions of Descartes, Boole, Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, and others. Connectionist approaches based on cybernetics or artificial neural networks were pushed to the background but have gained new prominence in recent decades.[22]"

    <br>"Generative AI refers to a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that is capable of generating new and original content, such as images, music, videos, and text. This is achieved through the use of deep learning algorithms and neural networks, which are trained on large datasets to learn the patterns and structure of the input data.
    <br>One popular approach to generative AI is through the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs), which consist of two neural networks that work together to generate new content. One network, called the generator, creates new samples that are similar to the training data, while the other network, called the discriminator, attempts to distinguish between the generated samples and the real ones.
    <br>Generative AI has many applications, including in art, music, and fashion, as well as in fields such as natural language processing and computer vision. However, it also raises ethical concerns, such as the potential for misuse or the creation of fake content. Therefore, it is important to approach the development and use of generative AI with caution and responsibility."

    <br>"A language model is a probability distribution over sequences of words.[1] Given any sequence of words of length m, a language model assigns a probability P(w1,...,wm) to the whole sequence. Language models generate probabilities by training on text corpora in one or many languages. Given that languages can be used to express an infinite variety of valid sentences (the property of digital infinity), language modeling faces the problem of assigning non-zero probabilities to linguistically valid sequences that may never be encountered in the training data. Several modelling approaches have been designed to surmount this problem, such as applying the Markov assumption or using neural architectures such as recurrent neural networks or transformers.
    <br>Language models are useful for a variety of problems in computational linguistics; from initial applications in speech recognition[2] to ensure nonsensical (i.e. low-probability) word sequences are not predicted, to wider use in machine translation[3] (e.g. scoring candidate translations), natural language generation (generating more human-like text), part-of-speech tagging, parsing,[3] optical character recognition, handwriting recognition,[4] grammar induction,[5] information retrieval,[6][7] and other applications."

    <br>"Neural language models (or continuous space language models) use continuous representations or embeddings of words to make their predictions.[10] These models make use of neural networks.
    <br>Continuous space embeddings help to alleviate the curse of dimensionality in language modeling: as language models are trained on larger and larger texts, the number of unique words (the vocabulary) increases.[a] The number of possible sequences of words increases exponentially with the size of the vocabulary, causing a data sparsity problem because of the exponentially many sequences. Thus, statistics are needed to properly estimate probabilities. Neural networks avoid this problem by representing words in a distributed way, as non-linear combinations of weights in a neural net.[11] An alternate description is that a neural net approximates the language function. The neural net architecture might be feed-forward or recurrent, and while the former is simpler the latter is more common."

    <br>"A large language model (LLM) is a language model consisting of a neural network with many parameters (typically billions of weights or more), trained on large quantities of unlabelled text using self-supervised learning. LLMs emerged around 2018 and perform well at a wide variety of tasks. This has shifted the focus of natural language processing research away from the previous paradigm of training specialized supervised models for specific tasks.[1]
    <br>Properties
    <br>Though the term large language model has no formal definition, it often refers to deep learning models having a parameter count on the order of billions or more.[2] LLMs are general purpose models which excel at a wide range of tasks, as opposed to being trained for one specific task (such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or mathematical reasoning).[1][3] The skill with which they accomplish tasks, and the range of tasks at which they are capable, seems to be a function of the amount of resources (data, parameter-size, computing power) devoted to them, in a way that is not dependent on additional breakthroughs in design.[4]
    <br>Though trained on simple tasks along the lines of predicting the next word in a sentence, neural language models with sufficient training and parameter counts are found to capture much of the syntax and semantics of human language. In addition, large language models demonstrate are able to "memorize" a great quantity of facts during training.[1] The ability of LLMs to often produce factually accurate responses can create the impression that they have general knowledge about the world; the production of responses with factual content that does not seem to be justified by the model's training data is referred to as a "hallucination".[5]"

    <br>Between 2018 and 2023, OpenAI released four major numbered GPT models, with each new release being significantly more capable than the previous, due to increased size (measured in number of trainable parameters) and training. The largest GPT-3 models, released in 2020, have 175 billion parameters and were trained on 400 billion tokens of text.[4] OpenAI declined to publish the size or training details of its most recent model, GPT-4, citing "the competitive landscape and the safety implications of large-scale models".[5] OpenAI has been using these foundational GPT-n models as the basis for various other products and technologies, including models fine-tuned for instruction following, which in turn power the ChatGPT chatbot service.
    <br>The term "GPT" is also used in the names of some generative LLMs developed by others, such as a series of GPT-3 inspired models created by EleutherAI,[6] and most recently a series of seven models created by Cerebras.[7] Major companies in other industries (e.g. sales, finance) also use the term "GPT" in the names of their services involving or utilizing a GPT technology.[8][9]"

    <br>"BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a pre-trained language model developed by Google in 2018. It is based on the transformer architecture and uses a large corpus of text to learn general language representations. BERT is trained in an unsupervised manner on a massive amount of text data and can be fine-tuned on various downstream natural language processing tasks such as question answering, text classification, and named entity recognition.
    <br>BERT uses a bidirectional approach, meaning that it takes into account the context of both preceding and following words in a sentence to generate word representations. This approach improves the ability of the model to capture the meaning of words in context, leading to better performance on downstream tasks. BERT also introduced a novel technique called "masked language modeling" where it randomly masks some words in the input sentence and then tries to predict the masked words based on the context.
    <br>Since its introduction, BERT has become one of the most widely used language models in the natural language processing community due to its state-of-the-art performance on many benchmark tasks. Its success has also led to the development of many variants and extensions, such as RoBERTa, ALBERT, and DistilBERT."

    <br>"Today, the Allen Institute for AI is excited to announce that we are embarking on the creation of an open, state-of-the-art generative language model: AI2 OLMo (Open Language Model). OLMo will be comparable in scale to other state-of-the-art large language models at 70 billion parameters, and is expected in early 2024.
    <br>OLMo will be a uniquely open language model intended to benefit the research community by providing access and education around all aspects of model creation. AI2 is developing OLMo in collaboration with AMD and CSC, using the new GPU portion of the all-AMD processor powered LUMI pre-exascale supercomputer — one of the greenest supercomputers in the world.
    <br>OLMo will be a new avenue for many people in the AI research community to work directly on language models for the first time. We will be making all elements of the OLMo project accessible — not only will our data be available, but so will the code used to create the data. We will open-source the model, the training code, the training curves, and evaluation benchmarks. We will also openly share and discuss the ethical and educational considerations around the creation of this model to help guide the understanding and responsible development of language modeling technology.
    <br>This broad availability of all aspects of OLMo will allow the research community to directly take what we create and work to improve it. We believe that millions of people want to better understand and engage with language models, and we aim to create the environment where they actually can, leading to faster and safer progress for everyone. Our goal is to collaboratively build the best open language model in the world — follow along with us on Twitter, our blog, and our newsletter to become a part of this important undertaking."

    <br>· "AI (Artificial Intelligence) and NLP (Natural Language Processing) are related but distinct fields in the realm of computer science and technology. Let's explore the differences between the two:
    <br>AI (Artificial Intelligence):
    <br>AI is a broad field that focuses on creating machines or systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. The goal of AI is to develop algorithms and models that enable computers to exhibit characteristics like learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. AI can be applied to various domains, including computer vision, robotics, speech recognition, game playing, and more.
    <br>AI encompasses several subfields, such as machine learning, deep learning, expert systems, knowledge representation, and natural language processing. NLP is one of these subfields that deals specifically with enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
    <br>NLP (Natural Language Processing):
    <br>NLP is a subset of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. Its primary aim is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate natural language in a way that is meaningful to humans. NLP seeks to bridge the gap between human language and computer language, enabling machines to comprehend and respond to textual or spoken language.
    <br>Key tasks in NLP include:
    <br>* Natural Language Understanding (NLU): Extracting meaning and insights from human language.
    <br>* Natural Language Generation (NLG): Creating human-readable text or speech from structured data or information.
    <br>* Sentiment Analysis: Determining the sentiment or emotion behind a piece of text.
    <br>* Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and classifying entities like names of people, places, and organizations in text.
    <br>* Machine Translation: Automatically translating text from one language to another.
    <br>* Speech Recognition: Converting spoken language into written text.
    <br>AI and NLP often intersect, as NLP techniques frequently rely on AI methods such as machine learning and deep learning to achieve their goals. For example, many state-of-the-art NLP models, such as transformers, are built using deep learning techniques like attention mechanisms.
    <br>In summary, AI is a broader field that encompasses NLP as one of its subfields. While AI deals with the creation of intelligent systems, NLP is specifically concerned with enabling computers to understand and generate human language. Both AI and NLP play crucial roles in developing technology that can interact with humans more naturally and intelligently."

    <br>"Speech recognition is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and computational linguistics that develops methodologies and technologies that enable the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers with the main benefit of searchability. It is also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer speech recognition or speech to text (STT). It incorporates knowledge and research in the computer science, linguistics and computer engineering fields. The reverse process is speech synthesis.
    <br>Some speech recognition systems require "training" (also called "enrollment") where an individual speaker reads text or isolated vocabulary into the system. The system analyzes the person's specific voice and uses it to fine-tune the recognition of that person's speech, resulting in increased accuracy. Systems that do not use training are called "speaker-independent"[1] systems. Systems that use training are called "speaker dependent".
    <br>Speech recognition applications include voice user interfaces such as voice dialing (e.g. "call home"), call routing (e.g. "I would like to make a collect call"), domotic appliance control, search key words (e.g. find a podcast where particular words were spoken), simple data entry (e.g., entering a credit card number), preparation of structured documents (e.g. a radiology report), determining speaker characteristics,[2] speech-to-text processing (e.g., word processors or emails), and aircraft (usually termed direct voice input).
    <br>The term voice recognition[3][4][5] or speaker identification[6][7][8] refers to identifying the speaker, rather than what they are saying. Recognizing the speaker can simplify the task of translating speech in systems that have been trained on a specific person's voice or it can be used to authenticate or verify the identity of a speaker as part of a security process.
    <br>From the technology perspective, speech recognition has a long history with several waves of major innovations. Most recently, the field has benefited from advances in deep learning and big data. The advances are evidenced not only by the surge of academic papers published in the field, but more importantly by the worldwide industry adoption of a variety of deep learning methods in designing and deploying speech recognition systems."

    <br>"A machine learning algorithm is an algorithm that is able to learn from data.But what do we mean by learning? Mitchell (1997) provides a succinct deﬁnition:“A computer program is said to learn from experienceEwith respect to someclass of tasksTand performance measureP, if its performance at tasks inT, asmeasured byP, improves with experienceE.” "

    <br>"A system is said to learn if it is capable of acquiring new knowledge from its environment.
    <br>Learning may also enable the ability to perform new tasks without having to be redesigned or reprogrammed, especially when accompanied by generalization.
    <br>Learning is most readily accomplished in a system that supports symbolic abstraction, though such a property is not exclusive (reinforcement strategies, for example, do not necessarily require symbolic representation).
    <br>This type of learning is separated from the acquisition of knowledge through direct programming by the designer, which is referred to throughout this document as the Ability to Add New Knowledge."

    <br>"Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.[1][2] It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.[3] Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or infeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.
    <br>Machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers. The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning.[5][6] In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics."

    <br>"Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.[2]
    <br>Deep-learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, deep reinforcement learning, recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks and transformers have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, climate science, material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance.[3][4][5]
    <br>Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems. ANNs have various differences from biological brains. Specifically, artificial neural networks tend to be static and symbolic, while the biological brain of most living organisms is dynamic (plastic) and analog.[6][7]
    <br>The adjective "deep" in deep learning refers to the use of multiple layers in the network. Early work showed that a linear perceptron cannot be a universal classifier, but that a network with a nonpolynomial activation function with one hidden layer of unbounded width can. Deep learning is a modern variation that is concerned with an unbounded number of layers of bounded size, which permits practical application and optimized implementation, while retaining theoretical universality under mild conditions. In deep learning the layers are also permitted to be heterogeneous and to deviate widely from biologically informed connectionist models, for the sake of efficiency, trainability and understandability."

    <br>"Supervised learning (SL) is a machine learning paradigm for problems where the available data consists of labeled examples, meaning that each data point contains features (covariates) and an associated label. The goal of supervised learning algorithms is learning a function that maps feature vectors (inputs) to labels (output), based on example input-output pairs.[1] It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples.[2] In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal). A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. An optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances. This requires the learning algorithm to generalize from the training data to unseen situations in a "reasonable" way (see inductive bias). This statistical quality of an algorithm is measured through the so-called generalization error."

    <br>In contrast to supervised learning where data is tagged by an expert, e.g. tagged as a "ball" or "fish", unsupervised methods exhibit self-organization that captures patterns as probability densities[1] or a combination of neural feature preferences encoded in the machine's weights and activations. The other levels in the supervision spectrum are reinforcement learning where the machine is given only a numerical performance score as guidance, and semi-supervised learning where a small portion of the data is tagged."

    <br>"Weak supervision, also called semi-supervised learning, is a branch of machine learning that combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data during training. Semi-supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning (with no labeled training data) and supervised learning (with only labeled training data). Semi-supervised learning aims to alleviate the issue of having limited amounts of labeled data available for training.
    <br>Semi-supervised learning is motivated by problem settings where unlabeled data is abundant and obtaining labeled data is expensive. Other branches of machine learning that share the same motivation but follow different assumptions and methodologies are active learning and weak supervision. Unlabeled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data, can produce considerable improvement in learning accuracy. The acquisition of labeled data for a learning problem often requires a skilled human agent (e.g. to transcribe an audio segment) or a physical experiment (e.g. determining the 3D structure of a protein or determining whether there is oil at a particular location). The cost associated with the labeling process thus may render large, fully labeled training sets infeasible, whereas acquisition of unlabeled data is relatively inexpensive. In such situations, semi-supervised learning can be of great practical value. Semi-supervised learning is also of theoretical interest in machine learning and as a model for human learning."

    <br>"Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
    <br>Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in not needing labelled input/output pairs to be presented, and in not needing sub-optimal actions to be explicitly corrected. Instead the focus is on finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge).[1]
    <br>The environment is typically stated in the form of a Markov decision process (MDP), because many reinforcement learning algorithms for this context use dynamic programming techniques.[2] The main difference between the classical dynamic programming methods and reinforcement learning algorithms is that the latter do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP and they target large MDPs where exact methods become infeasible."

    <br>===
    <br>"Reinforcement learning (RL) is learning by interacting with an environment. An RL agent learns from the consequences of its actions, rather than from being explicitly taught and it selects its actions on basis of its past experiences (exploitation) and also by new choices (exploration), which is essentially trial and error learning. The reinforcement signal that the RL-agent receives is a numerical reward, which encodes the success of an action's outcome, and the agent seeks to learn to select actions that maximize the accumulated reward over time. (The use of the term reward is used here in a neutral fashion and does not imply any pleasure, hedonic impact or other psychological interpretations.)"

The study of automated reasoning helps produce computer programs that allow computers to reason completely, or nearly completely, automatically. Although automated reasoning is considered a sub-field of artificial intelligence, it also has connections with theoretical computer science and philosophy.
    <br>The most developed subareas of automated reasoning are automated theorem proving (and the less automated but more pragmatic subfield of interactive theorem proving) and automated proof checking (viewed as guaranteed correct reasoning under fixed assumptions).[citation needed] Extensive work has also been done in reasoning by analogy using induction and abduction.[1]
    <br>Other important topics include reasoning under uncertainty and non-monotonic reasoning. An important part of the uncertainty field is that of argumentation, where further constraints of minimality and consistency are applied on top of the more standard automated deduction. John Pollock's OSCAR system[2] is an example of an automated argumentation system that is more specific than being just an automated theorem prover.

    <br>"Artificial neural networks (ANNs), usually simply called neural networks (NNs) or neural nets,[1] are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.[2]
    <br>An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit a signal to other neurons. An artificial neuron receives signals then processes them and can signal neurons connected to it. The "signal" at a connection is a real number, and the output of each neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections are called edges. Neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Neurons may have a threshold such that a signal is sent only if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold.
    <br>Typically, neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer), to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times."

    <br>"An artificial neuron is a mathematical function conceived as a model of biological neurons, a neural network. Artificial neurons are elementary units in an artificial neural network.[1] The artificial neuron receives one or more inputs (representing excitatory postsynaptic potentials and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials at neural dendrites) and sums them to produce an output (or activation, representing a neuron's action potential which is transmitted along its axon). Usually each input is separately weighted, and the sum is passed through a non-linear function known as an activation function or transfer function[clarification needed]. The transfer functions usually have a sigmoid shape, but they may also take the form of other non-linear functions, piecewise linear functions, or step functions. They are also often monotonically increasing, continuous, differentiable and bounded. Non-monotonic, unbounded and oscillating activation functions with multiple zeros that outperform sigmoidal and ReLU like activation functions on many tasks have also been recently explored. The thresholding function has inspired building logic gates referred to as threshold logic; applicable to building logic circuits resembling brain processing. For example, new devices such as memristors have been extensively used to develop such logic in recent times.[2]
    <br>The artificial neuron transfer function should not be confused with a linear system's transfer function.
    <br>Artificial neurons can also refer to artificial cells in neuromorphic engineering (see below) that are similar to natural physical neurons."

    <br>· "A deep neural network (DNN) is an artificial neural network (ANN) with multiple layers between the input and output layers.[10][13] There are different types of neural networks but they always consist of the same components: neurons, synapses, weights, biases, and functions.[137] These components as a whole function similarly to a human brain, and can be trained like any other ML algorithm.[citation needed]
    <br>For example, a DNN that is trained to recognize dog breeds will go over the given image and calculate the probability that the dog in the image is a certain breed. The user can review the results and select which probabilities the network should display (above a certain threshold, etc.) and return the proposed label. Each mathematical manipulation as such is considered a layer,[citation needed] and complex DNN have many layers, hence the name "deep" networks.
    <br>DNNs can model complex non-linear relationships. DNN architectures generate compositional models where the object is expressed as a layered composition of primitives.[138] The extra layers enable composition of features from lower layers, potentially modeling complex data with fewer units than a similarly performing shallow network.[10] For instance, it was proved that sparse multivariate polynomials are exponentially easier to approximate with DNNs than with shallow networks.[139]
    <br>Deep architectures include many variants of a few basic approaches. Each architecture has found success in specific domains. It is not always possible to compare the performance of multiple architectures, unless they have been evaluated on the same data sets.
    <br>DNNs are typically feedforward networks in which data flows from the input layer to the output layer without looping back. At first, the DNN creates a map of virtual neurons and assigns random numerical values, or "weights", to connections between them. The weights and inputs are multiplied and return an output between 0 and 1. If the network did not accurately recognize a particular pattern, an algorithm would adjust the weights.[140] That way the algorithm can make certain parameters more influential, until it determines the correct mathematical manipulation to fully process the data.
    <br>Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), in which data can flow in any direction, are used for applications such as language modeling.[141][142][143][144][145] Long short-term memory is particularly effective for this use.[75][146]
    <br>Convolutional deep neural networks (CNNs) are used in computer vision.[147] CNNs also have been applied to acoustic modeling for automatic speech recognition (ASR).[148]"

    <br>· "In machine learning, a deep belief network (DBN) is a generative graphical model, or alternatively a class of deep neural network, composed of multiple layers of latent variables ("hidden units"), with connections between the layers but not between units within each layer.[1]
    <br>When trained on a set of examples without supervision, a DBN can learn to probabilistically reconstruct its inputs. The layers then act as feature detectors.[1] After this learning step, a DBN can be further trained with supervision to perform classification.[2]
    <br>DBNs can be viewed as a composition of simple, unsupervised networks such as restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs)[1] or autoencoders,[3] where each sub-network's hidden layer serves as the visible layer for the next. An RBM is an undirected, generative energy-based model with a "visible" input layer and a hidden layer and connections between but not within layers. This composition leads to a fast, layer-by-layer unsupervised training procedure, where contrastive divergence is applied to each sub-network in turn, starting from the "lowest" pair of layers (the lowest visible layer is a training set).
    <br>The observation[2] that DBNs can be trained greedily, one layer at a time, led to one of the first effective deep learning algorithms.[4]: 6  Overall, there are many attractive implementations and uses of DBNs in real-life applications and scenarios (e.g., electroencephalography,[5] drug discovery[6][7][8])."

    <br>"Long short-term memory (LSTM)[1] is an artificial neural network used in the fields of artificial intelligence and deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. Such a recurrent neural network (RNN) can process not only single data points (such as images), but also entire sequences of data (such as speech or video). This characteristic makes LSTM networks ideal for processing and predicting data. For example, LSTM is applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition,[2] speech recognition,[3][4] machine translation,[5][6] speech activity detection,[7] robot control,[8][9] video games,[10][11] and healthcare.[12]
    <br>The name of LSTM refers to the analogy that a standard RNN has both "long-term memory" and "short-term memory". The connection weights and biases in the network change once per episode of training, analogous to how physiological changes in synaptic strengths store long-term memories; the activation patterns in the network change once per time-step, analogous to how the moment-to-moment change in electric firing patterns in the brain store short-term memories.[13] The LSTM architecture aims to provide a short-term memory for RNN that can last thousands of timesteps, thus "long short-term memory".[1]
    <br>A common LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an input gate, an output gate[14] and a forget gate.[15] The cell remembers values over arbitrary time intervals and the three gates regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell. Forget gates decide what information to discard from a previous state by assigning a previous state, compared to a current input, a value between 0 and 1. A (rounded) value of 1 means to keep the information, and a value of 0 means to discard it. Input gates decide which pieces of new information to store in the current state, using the same system as forget gates. Output gates control which pieces of information in the current state to output by assigning a value from 0 to 1 to the information, considering the previous and current states. Selectively outputting relevant information from the current state allows the LSTM network to maintain useful, long-term dependencies to make predictions, both in current and future time-steps.
    <br>LSTM networks are well-suited to classifying, processing and making predictions based on time series data, since there can be lags of unknown duration between important events in a time series. LSTMs were developed to deal with the vanishing gradient problem[16] that can be encountered when training traditional RNNs. Relative insensitivity to gap length is an advantage of LSTM over RNNs, hidden Markov models and other sequence learning methods in numerous applications."

    <br>"A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a class of artificial neural networks where connections between nodes can create a cycle, allowing output from some nodes to affect subsequent input to the same nodes. This allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior. Derived from feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal state (memory) to process variable length sequences of inputs.[1][2][3] This makes them applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition[4] or speech recognition.[5][6] Recurrent neural networks are theoretically Turing complete and can run arbitrary programs to process arbitrary sequences of inputs.[7]
    <br>The term "recurrent neural network" is used to refer to the class of networks with an infinite impulse response, whereas "convolutional neural network" refers to the class of finite impulse response. Both classes of networks exhibit temporal dynamic behavior.[8] A finite impulse recurrent network is a directed acyclic graph that can be unrolled and replaced with a strictly feedforward neural network, while an infinite impulse recurrent network is a directed cyclic graph that can not be unrolled.
    <br>Both finite impulse and infinite impulse recurrent networks can have additional stored states, and the storage can be under direct control by the neural network. The storage can also be replaced by another network or graph if that incorporates time delays or has feedback loops. Such controlled states are referred to as gated state or gated memory, and are part of long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and gated recurrent units. This is also called Feedback Neural Network (FNN)."

    <br>"A transformer is a deep learning model that adopts the mechanism of self-attention, differentially weighting the significance of each part of the input data. It is used primarily in the fields of natural language processing (NLP)[1] and computer vision (CV).[2]
    <br>Like recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers are designed to process sequential input data, such as natural language, with applications towards tasks such as translation and text summarization. However, unlike RNNs, transformers process the entire input all at once. The attention mechanism provides context for any position in the input sequence. For example, if the input data is a natural language sentence, the transformer does not have to process one word at a time. This allows for more parallelization than RNNs and therefore reduces training times.[1]
    <br>Transformers were introduced in 2017 by a team at Google Brain[1] and are increasingly becoming the model of choice for NLP problems,[3] replacing RNN models such as long short-term memory (LSTM). The additional training parallelization allows training on larger datasets. This led to the development of pretrained systems such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), which were trained with large language datasets, such as the Wikipedia Corpus and Common Crawl, and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks."

    <br>"While Transformer models have been very successful in natural language processing tasks, there are some criticisms of the architecture and its use.
    <br>* Over-reliance on large amounts of data: Transformer models require large amounts of data for training, which can be difficult to obtain for some languages or domains. This can lead to biases in the model and limit its generalization ability.
    <br>* Interpretability: Transformer models can be difficult to interpret, which can make it challenging to understand how they arrive at their predictions. This is particularly important in applications where it is necessary to understand the reasoning behind the model's decisions.
    <br>* High computational requirements: Training and using Transformer models can be computationally expensive, which can limit their accessibility and use in resource-constrained environments.
    <br>* Lack of long-term understanding: While Transformer models are very good at understanding short-term relationships between words, they can struggle with long-term dependencies. This can make it difficult to generate coherent and meaningful text over longer sequences.
    <br>* Fairness and bias: Transformer models can inherit biases from the training data, which can lead to unfair and discriminatory outcomes in some applications. This is a particularly important concern in applications such as hiring, lending, and criminal justice.
    <br>* Carbon footprint: Training large Transformer models can consume a significant amount of energy, which can contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and exacerbate climate change.

    <br>· "Quantum neural networks are computational neural network models which are based on the principles of quantum mechanics. The first ideas on quantum neural computation were published independently in 1995 by Subhash Kak and Ron Chrisley,[1][2] engaging with the theory of quantum mind, which posits that quantum effects play a role in cognitive function. However, typical research in quantum neural networks involves combining classical artificial neural network models (which are widely used in machine learning for the important task of pattern recognition) with the advantages of quantum information in order to develop more efficient algorithms.[3][4][5] One important motivation for these investigations is the difficulty to train classical neural networks, especially in big data applications. The hope is that features of quantum computing such as quantum parallelism or the effects of interference and entanglement can be used as resources. Since the technological implementation of a quantum computer is still in a premature stage, such quantum neural network models are mostly theoretical proposals that await their full implementation in physical experiments.
    <br>Most Quantum neural networks are developed as feed-forward networks. Similar to their classical counterparts, this structure intakes input from one layer of qubits, and passes that input onto another layer of qubits. This layer of qubits evaluates this information and passes on the output to the next layer. Eventually the path leads to the final layer of qubits.[6][7] The layers do not have to be of the same width, meaning they don't have to have the same number of qubits as the layer before or after it. This structure is trained on which path to take similar to classical artificial neural networks. This is discussed in a lower section. Quantum neural networks refer to three different categories: Quantum computer with classical data, classical computer with quantum data, and quantum computer with quantum data.[6]"

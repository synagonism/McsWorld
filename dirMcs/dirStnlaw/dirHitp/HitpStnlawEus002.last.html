  <h2 id="idD1H2">1. Declaration concerning the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idD1H2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idD1P1">The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which has legally binding force, confirms the fundamental rights guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States.
    <br>
    <br>The Charter does not extend the field of application of Union law beyond the powers of the Union or establish any new power or task for the Union, or modify powers and tasks as defined by the Treaties.

  <h2 id="idD10H2">10. Declaration on <a class="clsPreview" href="t.2010.cns.eu.html#idA17">Article 17 of the Treaty on European Union</a>
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idD10H2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idD10P1">The Conference considers that when the Commission no longer includes nationals of all Member States, the Commission should pay particular attention to the need to ensure full transparency in relations with all Member States. Accordingly, the Commission should liaise closely with all Member States, whether or not they have a national serving as member of the Commission, and in this context pay special attention to the need to share information and consult with all Member States.
    <br>
    <br>The Conference also considers that the Commission should take all the necessary measures to ensure that political, social and economic realities in all Member States, including those which have no national serving as member of the Commission, are fully taken into account. These measures should include ensuring that the position of those Member States is addressed by appropriate organisational arrangements.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idD11H2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idD11P1">The Conference considers that, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaties, the European Parliament and the European Council are jointly responsible for the smooth running of the process leading to the election of the President of the European Commission. Prior to the decision of the European Council, representatives of the European Parliament and of the European Council will thus conduct the necessary consultations in the framework deemed the most appropriate. These consultations will focus on the backgrounds of the candidates for President of the Commission, taking account of the elections to the European Parliament, in accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 17(7). The arrangements for such consultations may be determined, in due course, by common accord between the European Parliament and the European Council.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idD12H2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idD12P1">1. The Conference declares that, in the course of the preparatory work preceding the appointment of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy which is due to take place on the date of entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon in accordance with <a class="clsPreview" href="t.2010.cns.eu.html#idA18">Article 18 of the Treaty on European Union</a> and Article 5 of the <a class="clsPreview" href="t.2010.cns.protocols.html#idPr36">Protocol on transitional provisions</a> and whose term of office will be from that date until the end of the term of office of the Commission in office on that date, appropriate contacts will be made with the European Parliament.

  <section id="idD13">
  <h2 id="idD13H2">13. Declaration concerning the common foreign and security policy
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idD13H2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idD13P1">The Conference underlines that the provisions in the Treaty on European Union covering the Common Foreign and Security Policy, including the creation of the office of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the establishment of an External Action Service, do not affect the responsibilities of the Member States, as they currently exist, for the formulation and conduct of their foreign policy nor of their national representation in third countries and international organisations.
    <br>
    <br>The Conference also recalls that the provisions governing the Common Security and Defence Policy do not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of the Member States.
    <br>
    <br>It stresses that the European Union and its Member States will remain bound by the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and, in particular, by the primary responsibility of the Security Council and of its Members for the maintenance of international peace and security.

  <section id="idD14">
  <h2 id="idD14H2">14. Declaration concerning the common foreign and security policy
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idD14H2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idD14P1">In addition to the specific rules and procedures referred to in paragraph 1 of <a class="clsPreview" href="t.2010.cns.eu.html#idA24">Article 24 of the Treaty on European Union</a>, the Conference underlines that the provisions covering the Common Foreign and Security Policy including in relation to the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the External Action Service will not affect the existing legal basis, responsibilities, and powers of each Member State in relation to the formulation and conduct of its foreign policy, its national diplomatic service, relations with third countries and participation in international organisations, including a Member State's membership of the Security Council of the United Nations.
    <br>
    <br>The Conference also notes that the provisions covering the Common Foreign and Security Policy do not give new powers to the Commission to initiate decisions nor do they increase the role of the European Parliament.
    <br>
    <br>The Conference also recalls that the provisions governing the Common Security and Defence Policy do not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of the Member States.

  <h2 id="idD15H2">15. Declaration on <a class="clsPreview" href="t.2010.cns.eu.html#idA27">Article 27 of the Treaty on European Union</a>
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idD15H2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idD15P1">The Conference declares that, as soon as the Treaty of Lisbon is signed, the Secretary-General of the Council, High Representative for the common foreign and security policy, the Commission and the Member States should begin preparatory work on the European External Action Service.

  <section id="idD16">
  <h2 id="idD16H2">16. Declaration on <a class="clsPreview" href="t.2010.cns.eu.html#idA55P2">Article 55(2) of the Treaty on European Union</a>
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idD16H2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idD16P1">The Conference considers that the possibility of producing translations of the Treaties in the languages mentioned in Article 55(2) contributes to fulfilling the objective of respecting the Union's rich cultural and linguistic diversity as set forth in the fourth subparagraph of Article 3(3). In this context, the Conference confirms the attachment of the Union to the cultural diversity of Europe and the special attention it will continue to pay to these and other languages.
    <br>
    <br>The Conference recommends that those Member States wishing to avail themselves of the possibility recognised in Article 55(2) communicate to the Council, within six months from the date of the signature of the Treaty of Lisbon, the language or languages into which translations of the Treaties will be made.

  <section id="idD17">
  <h2 id="idD17H2">17. Declaration concerning primacy
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idD17H2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idD17P1">The Conference recalls that, in accordance with well settled case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the Treaties and the law adopted by the Union on the basis of the Treaties have primacy over the law of Member States, under the conditions laid down by the said case law.
    <br>
    <br>The Conference has also decided to attach as an Annex to this Final Act the Opinion of the Council Legal Service on the primacy of EC law as set out in 11197/07 (JUR 260):
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idD17P1"></a></p>
  <p id="idD17P2" class="clsCenter">'Opinion of the Council Legal Service
    <br>of 22 June 2007
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idD17P2"></a></p>
  <p id="idD17P2" class="clsIndent">It results from the case-law of the Court of Justice that primacy of EC law is a cornerstone principle of Community law. According to the Court, this principle is inherent to the specific nature of the European Community. At the time of the first judgment of this established case law (Costa/ENEL,15 July 1964, Case 6/641 <a href="#idD17N">( 1 )</a> there was no mention of primacy in the treaty. It is still the case today.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idD18H2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idD18P1">The Conference underlines that, in accordance with the system of division of competences between the Union and the Member States as provided for in the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, competences not conferred upon the Union in the Treaties remain with the Member States.
    <br>
    <br>When the Treaties confer on the Union a competence shared with the Member States in a specific area, the Member States shall exercise their competence to the extent that the Union has not exercised, or has decided to cease exercising, its competence. The latter situation arises when the relevant EU institutions decide to repeal a legislative act, in particular better to ensure constant respect for the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. The Council may, at the initiative of one or several of its members (representatives of Member States) and in accordance with <a class="clsPreview" href="t.2010.cns.feu.html#idA241">Article 241 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union</a>, request the Commission to submit proposals for repealing a legislative act. The Conference welcomes the Commission's declaration that it will devote particular attention to these requests.
    <br>
    <br>Equally, the representatives of the governments of the Member States, meeting in an Intergovernmental Conference, in accordance with the ordinary revision procedure provided for in <a class="clsPreview" href="t.2010.cns.eu.html#idA48">Article 48(2) to (5) of the Treaty on European Union</a>, may decide to amend the Treaties upon which the Union is founded, including either to increase or to reduce the competences conferred on the Union in the said Treaties.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idD30H2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idD30P1">With regard to Article 126, the Conference confirms that raising growth potential and securing sound budgetary positions are the two pillars of the economic and fiscal policy of the Union and the Member States. The Stability and Growth Pact is an important tool to achieve these goals.
    <br>
    <br>The Conference reaffirms its commitment to the provisions concerning the Stability and Growth Pact as the framework for the coordination of budgetary policies in the Member States.
    <br>
    <br>The Conference confirms that a rule-based system is the best guarantee for commitments to be enforced and for all Member States to be treated equally.
    <br>
    <br>Within this framework, the Conference also reaffirms its commitment to the goals of the Lisbon Strategy: job creation, structural reforms, and social cohesion.
    <br>
    <br>The Union aims at achieving balanced economic growth and price stability. Economic and budgetary policies thus need to set the right priorities towards economic reforms, innovation, competitiveness and strengthening of private investment and consumption in phases of weak economic growth. This should be reflected in the orientations of budgetary decisions at the national and Union level in particular through restructuring of public revenue and expenditure while respecting budgetary discipline in accordance with the Treaties and the Stability and Growth Pact.
    <br>
    <br>Budgetary and economic challenges facing the Member States underline the importance of sound budgetary policy throughout the economic cycle.
    <br>
    <br>The Conference agrees that Member States should use periods of economic recovery actively to consolidate public finances and improve their budgetary positions. The objective is to gradually achieve a budgetary surplus in good times which creates the necessary room to accommodate economic downturns and thus contribute to the long-term sustainability of public finances.
    <br>
    <br>The Member States look forward to possible proposals of the Commission as well as further contributions of Member States with regard to strengthening and clarifying the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact. The Member States will take all necessary measures to raise the growth potential of their economies. Improved economic policy coordination could support this objective. This Declaration does not prejudge the future debate on the Stability and Growth Pact.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idD49H2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idD49P1">The Conference notes that the Protocol on Italy annexed in 1957 to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, as amended upon adoption of the Treaty on European Union, stated that:
    <br>
    <br>'THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES,
    <br>
    <br>DESIRING to settle certain particular problems relating to Italy,
    <br>
    <br>HAVE AGREED UPON the following provisions, which shall be annexed to this Treaty:
    <br>
    <br>THE MEMBER STATES OF THE COMMUNITY
    <br>
    <br>TAKE NOTE of the fact that the Italian Government is carrying out a ten-year programme of economic expansion designed to rectify the disequilibria in the structure of the Italian economy, in particular by providing an infrastructure for the less developed areas in Southern Italy and in the Italian islands and by creating new jobs in order to eliminate unemployment;
    <br>
    <br>RECALL that the principles and objectives of this programme of the Italian Government have been considered and approved by organisations for international cooperation of which the Member States are members;
    <br>
    <br>RECOGNISE that it is in their common interest that the objectives of the Italian programme should be attained;
    <br>
    <br>AGREE, in order to facilitate the accomplishment of this task by the Italian Government, to recommend to the institutions of the Community that they should employ all the methods and procedures provided in this Treaty and, in particular, make appropriate use of the resources of the European Investment Bank and the European Social Fund;
    <br>
    <br>ARE OF THE OPINION that the institutions of the Community should, in applying this Treaty, take account of the sustained effort to be made by the Italian economy in the coming years and of the desirability of avoiding dangerous stresses in particular within the balance of payments or the level of employment, which might jeopardise the application of this Treaty in Italy;
    <br>
    <br>RECOGNISE that in the event of Articles 109 H and 109 I being applied it will be necessary to take care that any measures required of the Italian Government do not prejudice the completion of its programme for economic expansion and for raising the standard of living of the population.'.

  <p id="idD51P1">Belgium wishes to make clear that, in accordance with its constitutional law, not only the Chamber of Representatives and Senate of the Federal Parliament but also the parliamentary assemblies of the Communities and the Regions act, in terms of the competences exercised by the Union, as components of the national parliamentary system or chambers of the national Parliament.

  <h2 id="idD53H2">53. Declaration by the Czech Republic on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idD53H2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idD53P1">1. The Czech Republic recalls that the provisions of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union are addressed to the institutions and bodies of the European Union with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity and division of competences between the European Union and its Member States, as reaffirmed in Declaration (No 18) in relation to the delimitation of competences. The Czech Republic stresses that its provisions are addressed to the Member States only when they are implementing Union law, and not when they are adopting and implementing national law independently from Union law.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idD53P1"></a></p>
  <p id="idD53P2">2. The Czech Republic also emphasises that the Charter does not extend the field of application of Union law and does not establish any new power for the Union. It does not diminish the field of application of national law and does not restrain any current powers of the national authorities in this field.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idD53P2"></a></p>
  <p id="idD53P3">3. The Czech Republic stresses that, in so far as the Charter recognises fundamental rights and principles as they result from constitutional traditions common to the Member States, those rights and principles are to be interpreted in harmony with those traditions.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idD53P3"></a></p>
  <p id="idD53P4">4. The Czech Republic further stresses that nothing in the Charter may be interpreted as restricting or adversely affecting human rights and fundamental freedoms as recognised, in their respective field of application, by Union law and by international agreements to which the Union or all the Member States are party, including the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and by the Member States' Constitutions.

  <p id="idD56P1">Ireland affirms its commitment to the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice respecting fundamental rights and the different legal systems and traditions of the Member States within which citizens are provided with a high level of safety.
    <br>
    <br>Accordingly, Ireland declares its firm intention to exercise its right under Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice to take part in the adoption of measures pursuant to <a class="clsPreview" href="t.2010.cns.feu.html#idP3T5">Title V of Part Three of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union</a> to the maximum extent it deems possible.
    <br>
    <br>Ireland will, in particular, participate to the maximum possible extent in measures in the field of police cooperation.
    <br>
    <br>Furthermore, Ireland recalls that in accordance with Article 8 of the Protocol it may notify the Council in writing that it no longer wishes to be covered by the terms of the Protocol. Ireland intends to review the operation of these arrangements within three years of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.

    <br>Italy likewise notes that on the basis of <a class="clsPreview" href="t.2010.cns.eu.html#idA9">Article 9 of the Treaty on European Union</a> and <a class="clsPreview" href="t.2010.cns.feu.html#idA20">Article 20 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union</a>, every national of a Member State is a citizen of the Union.
    <br>
    <br>Italy therefore considers that, without prejudice to the decision on the 2009-2014 legislative period, any decision adopted by the European Council, at the initiative of the European Parliament and with its consent, establishing the composition of the European Parliament, must abide by the principles laid down out in the first subparagraph of Article 14.

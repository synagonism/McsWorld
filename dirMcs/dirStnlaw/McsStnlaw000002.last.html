  <p id="idOverviewdsnL">descriptionLong::
    <br>"Law is commonly understood as a system of rules that are created and enforced through social or governmental institutions to regulate conduct,[2] although its precise definition is a matter of longstanding debate.[3][4][5] It has been variously described as a science[6][7] and the art of justice.[8][9][10] State-enforced laws can be made by a collective legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes, by the executive through decrees and regulations, or established by judges through precedent, normally in common law jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people."

    <br>
    <br>">subject of law:
    <br>The "subject of law" can have different meanings depending on the context. Here are a few possible interpretations:
    <br>
    <br>1. **Legal Person or Entity:**
    <br>   - In a broad legal sense, a "subject of law" can refer to any entity, whether an individual or a group, that is capable of holding legal rights and duties. This includes both natural persons (individuals) and legal persons (entities recognized by the law, such as corporations, organizations, or even states).
    <br>
    <br>2. **Legal Personality:**
    <br>   - The concept of "legal personality" is related to the capacity of entities to have legal rights and obligations. In many legal systems, individuals are recognized as having legal personality by default. However, legal systems also grant legal personality to entities like corporations, allowing them to enter into contracts, sue, and be sued.
    <br>
    <br>3. **Legal Subjects in a Case:**
    <br>   - In the context of a legal case, the "subjects of law" may refer to the parties involved—those who are bringing a legal action (plaintiffs) and those against whom the action is brought (defendants). These individuals or entities are the subjects of the legal proceedings.
    <br>
    <br>4. **Legal Subjects in a Legal System:**
    <br>   - In a broader sense, "subjects of law" can also refer to the entities that are subject to the laws and regulations of a particular legal system. This includes both individuals and organizations that must comply with the laws of a given jurisdiction.
    <br>
    <br>5. **International Law:**
    <br>   - In the realm of international law, the "subjects of law" primarily refer to states as the main actors. However, the concept has expanded to include international organizations and, to some extent, individuals who may have rights and responsibilities under international law.
    <br>
    <br>Understanding the specific context in which the term is used is crucial for a precise interpretation. In general, it refers to entities or individuals that are recognized as having legal standing or capacity within a legal system."

    <br>">subject of law:
    <br>The subject of law is a broad and complex one, encompassing a wide range of topics and concepts. At its core, law is a system of rules that govern human behavior, and the subject of law seeks to understand and interpret these rules in order to ensure that they are applied fairly and justly.
    <br>
    <br>**What is law?**
    <br>Law is a system of rules that govern human behavior. These rules are typically created by legislatures, courts, and other government bodies, and they are enforced through a system of sanctions. The purpose of law is to protect individuals and society from harm, to promote justice and fairness, and to maintain order and stability.
    <br>
    <br>**What are the different types of law?**
    <br>There are many different types of law, but they can be broadly divided into two categories: civil law and criminal law. Civil law deals with disputes between individuals or organizations, while criminal law deals with offenses against the state.
    <br>
    <br>**What are the sources of law?**
    <br>There are several sources of law, including statutes, regulations, case law, and constitutional law. Statutes are laws that are enacted by legislatures, while regulations are laws that are created by administrative agencies. Case law is the law that is created by courts, and it is based on the decisions of judges in previous cases. Constitutional law is the law that is found in constitutions, which are the fundamental documents of government.
    <br>
    <br>**What are the different branches of law?**
    <br>There are many different branches of law, but some of the most common include:
    <br>* **Contract law:** This branch of law deals with contracts, which are agreements between two or more parties.
    <br>* **Tort law:** This branch of law deals with civil wrongs, such as negligence and intentional harm.
    <br>* **Criminal law:** This branch of law deals with offenses against the state, such as murder, theft, and assault.
    <br>* **Property law:** This branch of law deals with the ownership and use of property.
    <br>* **Family law:** This branch of law deals with relationships between family members, such as marriage, divorce, and child custody.
    <br>* **Business law:** This branch of law deals with business organizations, such as corporations, partnerships, and limited liability companies.
    <br>
    <br>**What are the roles of lawyers and judges?**
    <br>Lawyers are legal professionals who advise and represent clients in legal matters. They also draft legal documents, such as contracts and wills. Judges are impartial decision-makers who preside over legal proceedings and apply the law to the facts of a case.
    <br>
    <br>**Conclusion**
    <br>The subject of law is a complex and fascinating one, and it is essential for anyone who wants to understand how society works. By studying law, we can learn about the rights and responsibilities of individuals, the role of government, and the importance of justice.
    <br>
    <br>I hope this helps!"

    <br>"law vs legal system:
    <br>"Law" and "legal system" are related concepts in the field of jurisprudence and governance, but they refer to different aspects of the legal framework within a society.
    <br>
    <br>1. Law:
    <br> - Definition: Law refers to a set of rules and regulations that are established and enforced by a governing authority (e.g., government or legislature) to regulate human behavior within a society or jurisdiction. These rules can cover a wide range of issues, including individual rights, obligations, responsibilities, and prohibitions.
    <br> - Characteristics:
    <br> - Laws can be written or unwritten (common law).
    <br> - They are designed to provide a framework for resolving disputes, maintaining order, and achieving justice.
    <br> - Laws can be divided into various categories, such as criminal law (dealing with offenses against the state), civil law (dealing with disputes between individuals or entities), and administrative law (governing government agencies).
    <br> - Sources of Law:
    <br> - Statutory law: Laws created by legislatures through the legislative process.
    <br> - Common law: Laws developed by courts through precedents and judicial decisions.
    <br> - Constitutional law: Fundamental laws that establish the framework of government.
    <br> - International law: Laws governing relations between countries.
    <br>
    <br>2. Legal System:
    <br> - Definition: A legal system is the overarching framework within which laws are created, interpreted, and enforced. It includes the institutions, processes, and mechanisms through which laws are applied and justice is administered within a specific jurisdiction.
    <br> - Characteristics:
    <br> - Legal systems can vary significantly from one country or region to another, reflecting cultural, historical, and political differences.
    <br> - They typically include key components such as the judiciary, legislative bodies, executive agencies, law enforcement, and legal professionals (lawyers and judges).
    <br> - Legal systems provide procedures for the resolution of disputes, the enforcement of laws, and the protection of rights.
    <br> - Types of Legal Systems:
    <br> - Common Law: Derived from judicial decisions and precedents, with a focus on case law.
    <br> - Civil Law: Based on codified statutes and comprehensive legal codes.
    <br> - Religious Law: Derived from religious texts and principles, often found in Islamic and some other religious societies.
    <br> - Customary Law: Evolves from long-standing cultural practices and traditions.
    <br> - Mixed Legal Systems: A combination of two or more of the above.
    <br>
    <br>In summary, "law" represents the rules and regulations that govern behavior, while the "legal system" encompasses the broader institutional framework for creating, interpreting, and enforcing those laws within a specific jurisdiction. Different countries and regions may have different legal systems and bodies of law, making the study of comparative law and legal systems an important field in understanding global legal diversity."

    <br>"legal system vs justice system:
    <br>The terms "legal system" and "justice system" are related but have distinct meanings:
    <br>
    <br>1. Legal System:
    <br> - The legal system refers to the set of laws, rules, regulations, and institutions that govern a society or jurisdiction. It encompasses the entire framework within which legal processes are established, interpreted, and enforced.
    <br> - The legal system includes legislative bodies that create laws, executive branches responsible for implementing and enforcing laws, and judicial branches that interpret and apply laws to resolve disputes.
    <br> - The legal system provides a structured and orderly way to address conflicts, regulate behavior, and ensure order in society. It is concerned with maintaining law and order, as well as upholding the rights and obligations of individuals and entities.
    <br>
    <br>2. Justice System:
    <br> - The justice system, on the other hand, is a subset of the legal system that specifically focuses on the administration of justice. It includes the courts, judges, lawyers, and other actors involved in the process of adjudicating legal disputes and ensuring that justice is served.
    <br> - The primary goal of the justice system is to ensure fairness, equity, and accountability in the application of laws. It is responsible for resolving disputes, punishing wrongdoers, and protecting the rights of individuals.
    <br> - The justice system plays a crucial role in upholding the rule of law and ensuring that individuals have access to a fair and impartial process when their rights are at stake.
    <br>
    <br>In summary, the legal system encompasses the entire framework of laws and institutions within a society, while the justice system is a component of the legal system that specifically deals with the administration of justice and the resolution of legal disputes. The justice system's ultimate aim is to ensure that justice is served and that individuals' rights are protected within the boundaries of the law."

    <br>The terms "justice system" and "judiciary" are related but refer to different aspects within the legal framework of a country:
    <br>
    <br>1. Judiciary:
    <br> - The judiciary is a specific component of the legal system that consists of courts, judges, and the legal professionals responsible for interpreting and applying the law. It is one of the three branches of government in many countries, alongside the legislative and executive branches.
    <br> - The judiciary's primary function is to adjudicate disputes, interpret laws, and ensure that justice is administered in accordance with the law. Judges within the judiciary are responsible for making legal decisions, rendering judgments, and upholding the rule of law.
    <br> - The judiciary plays a crucial role in safeguarding individual rights, resolving legal conflicts, and ensuring that the actions of the government and individuals are in compliance with the constitution and established laws.
    <br>
    <br>2. Justice System:
    <br> - The justice system is a broader term that encompasses not only the judiciary but also other components of the legal system, such as law enforcement agencies, prosecutors, defense attorneys, correctional facilities, and other entities involved in the administration of justice.
    <br> - While the judiciary focuses primarily on the resolution of disputes through the legal process, the justice system includes the entire process of maintaining law and order, enforcing laws, investigating and prosecuting crimes, and providing correctional and rehabilitation services for individuals who have been convicted of crimes.
    <br> - The justice system is concerned with ensuring that the principles of fairness, due process, and equality are upheld at all stages of the legal process, from law enforcement and investigation to trial and punishment.
    <br>
    <br>In summary, the judiciary is a specific part of the justice system, dealing primarily with the adjudication of legal disputes and the interpretation of laws. The justice system, on the other hand, is a more comprehensive term that encompasses the entire legal framework and its various components, including law enforcement, prosecution, defense, and corrections, all working together to maintain justice and order in society."

    <br>"judiciary definition:
    <br>The judiciary is the branch of government that is responsible for interpreting and applying the law. It is also known as the judicial system, judicature, judicial branch, judiciative branch, and court or judiciary system.
    <br>
    <br>The judiciary is responsible for adjudicating legal disputes, which means resolving them through a fair and impartial process. The judiciary also has the power to interpret the law, which means explaining what the law means and how it applies to specific cases. In some countries, the judiciary also has the power to strike down laws that it deems to be unconstitutional.
    <br>
    <br>The judiciary is an essential part of any democracy. It helps to ensure that the law is applied fairly and equally to everyone, and that the rights of all citizens are protected.
    <br>
    <br>Here are some of the key functions of the judiciary:
    <br>* To resolve legal disputes between individuals, groups, and organizations
    <br>* To interpret the law and apply it to specific cases
    <br>* To protect the rights of individuals and groups
    <br>* To ensure that the government and its officials act within the law
    <br>* To uphold the rule of law
    <br>
    <br>The judiciary is typically made up of a system of courts, each with a different level of jurisdiction. The highest court in a country is usually known as the supreme court. The supreme court has the final say on the interpretation of the law, and its decisions are binding on all lower courts.
    <br>
    <br>In many countries, the judiciary is independent of the other two branches of government: the legislative branch (which makes the laws) and the executive branch (which enforces the laws). This independence is essential to ensure that the judiciary can act impartially and without fear of pressure from the other branches of government.
    <br>
    <br>The judiciary is an essential part of any democracy. It helps to ensure that the law is applied fairly and equally to everyone, and that the rights of all citizens are protected."

    <br>">evolution of legal-system:
    <br>The evolution of legal systems is a complex and multifaceted process that has unfolded over centuries, shaped by cultural, social, economic, and political factors. Different societies and civilizations have developed their own legal systems, each reflecting their unique values, traditions, and institutions. Here's a broad overview of the evolution of legal systems:
    <br>
    <br>1. **Early Legal Systems:**
    <br>   - **Ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt:** Some of the earliest legal codes, such as the Code of Ur-Nammu (circa 2100-2050 BCE) and the more famous Code of Hammurabi (circa 1754 BCE), emerged in Mesopotamia. These early legal codes focused on issues like property, contracts, and family matters.
    <br>   - **Ancient Greece and Rome:** The Greeks and Romans developed legal systems that influenced Western legal thought. The Roman Republic's Twelve Tables (450 BCE) codified laws and established principles of justice.
    <br>
    <br>2. **Medieval Legal Systems:**
    <br>   - **Feudal Europe:** During the medieval period, feudalism shaped legal systems in Europe. Local lords administered justice, and legal principles were often based on customary law.
    <br>   - **Islamic Legal System:** The Islamic legal system, derived from Sharia law, evolved during the medieval period, with legal scholars interpreting religious texts to derive laws governing various aspects of life.
    <br>
    <br>3. **Common Law and Civil Law Traditions:**
    <br>   - **Common Law:** In medieval England, common law emerged, relying on judicial decisions and precedents. This system spread to the British colonies and has significantly influenced legal systems in countries like the United States, Canada, and Australia.
    <br>   - **Civil Law:** In continental Europe, the Roman legal tradition persisted, leading to the development of civil law systems. These systems are based on comprehensive legal codes, with judges relying more on codified statutes than precedent.
    <br>
    <br>4. **Modern Legal Systems:**
    <br>   - **National Legal Codes:** Many nations developed comprehensive legal codes during the 18th and 19th centuries, reflecting the ideals of the Enlightenment. For example, Napoleon's Civil Code (1804) had a profound impact on legal systems in many countries.
    <br>   - **Globalization and International Law:** In the 20th and 21st centuries, the rise of globalization has led to the development of international legal systems and organizations, such as the United Nations and the International Criminal Court, to address issues that transcend national boundaries.
    <br>
    <br>5. **Emerging Trends:**
    <br>   - **Technology and Law:** The 21st century has seen the integration of technology into legal systems, affecting everything from legal research to the delivery of legal services.
    <br>   - **Human Rights:** There is a growing emphasis on human rights in legal systems worldwide, with international and domestic laws addressing issues like discrimination, freedom of speech, and the rights of marginalized groups.
    <br>
    <br>The evolution of legal systems is an ongoing process shaped by societal changes, technological advancements, and the pursuit of justice and fairness. Different regions and cultures continue to adapt and modify their legal frameworks to meet the evolving needs of their societies."

    <br>"The term ‘legal source’ has two meanings:
    <br>in its original meaning, it refers to the reason for the emergence of a legal provision, i.e. the motivation behind the creation of a legal construct. According to this definition, the ‘legal source’ of Union law is the will to preserve peace and create a better Europe through closer economic ties — two cornerstones of the EU.
    <br>In legal parlance, however, ‘legal source’ refers to the origin and embodiment of the law."
    <br>[{2020-11-30} https://op.europa.eu/webpub/com/abc-of-eu-law/en/]
    <br>
    <br>">source of law:
    <br>The sources of law are the origins of the rules that govern human behavior. In different legal systems, there are various sources of law, but some of the most common include:
    <br>
    <br>1. **Constitutions:** Constitutions are the supreme law of a country and establish the framework for the government, including its powers and limitations. They also enshrine fundamental rights and freedoms for citizens.
    <br>
    <br>2. **Statutes:** Statutes are laws enacted by the legislative branch of government, such as Congress or a state legislature. They are typically written in general terms and apply to a broad range of situations.
    <br>
    <br>3. **Regulations:** Regulations are rules created by administrative agencies, which are government bodies responsible for enforcing specific laws. They provide more detailed guidance on how statutes should be applied.
    <br>
    <br>4. **Case law:** Case law is the law created by courts through their decisions in legal disputes. It is based on the principle of stare decisis, which means that courts should follow the precedents set by previous decisions.
    <br>
    <br>5. **Treaties:** Treaties are agreements between two or more countries that are binding on international law. They can establish new laws or modify existing ones.
    <br>
    <br>6. **Customary law:** Customary law is based on long-standing traditions and practices that are accepted as binding by a particular community. It is most commonly found in common law systems.
    <br>
    <br>In addition to these primary sources of law, there are also secondary sources, which are materials that provide information about the law. These include legal encyclopedias, treatises, and law review articles.
    <br>
    <br>The relative importance of different sources of law varies depending on the legal system. In common law systems, case law is a primary source of law, while in civil law systems, statutes and codes are more important.
    <br>
    <br>Here is a table summarizing the different sources of law:
    <br>| Source of Law | Description | Example |
    <br>| Constitutions | The supreme law of a country | The United States Constitution |
    <br>| Statutes | Laws enacted by the legislative branch of government | The Clean Air Act |
    <br>| Regulations | Rules created by administrative agencies | The Environmental Protection Agency's regulations on air pollution |
    <br>| Case law | Law created by courts through their decisions in legal disputes | Brown v. Board of Education |
    <br>| Treaties | Agreements between two or more countries | The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) |
    <br>| Customary law | Law based on long-standing traditions and practices | The law of the sea |
    <br>| Secondary sources | Materials that provide information about the law | Legal encyclopedias, treatises, and law review articles |"

    <br>"Jurisprudence or legal theory is the theoretical study of law. Scholars of jurisprudence seek to explain the nature of law in its most general form and provide a deeper understanding of legal reasoning, legal systems, legal institutions, and the role of law in society.[1]
    <br>Modern jurisprudence began in the 18th century and was focused on the first principles of natural law, civil law, and the law of nations.[2] General jurisprudence can be divided into categories both by the type of question scholars seek to answer and by the theories of jurisprudence, or schools of thought, regarding how those questions are best answered. Contemporary philosophy of law, which deals with general jurisprudence, addresses problems internal to law and legal systems and problems of law as a social institution that relates to the larger political and social context in which it exists.[3]"

    <br>"evolution of jurisprudence:
    <br>Jurisprudence, or the philosophy of law, has undergone significant evolution over the centuries, reflecting changes in societal values, political structures, and intellectual currents. Here's a broad overview of the evolution of jurisprudence:
    <br>
    <br>1. **Ancient Legal Philosophies:**
    <br>   - **Greek and Roman Philosophies:** Early Western legal thought was heavily influenced by Greek and Roman philosophers. Thinkers like Plato and Aristotle explored concepts of justice, law, and governance.
    <br>
    <br>2. **Medieval Period:**
    <br>   - **Scholasticism:** During the medieval period, Scholastic philosophers, particularly in Europe, sought to reconcile Christian theology with classical philosophy. Legal thought was often intertwined with religious principles.
    <br>
    <br>3. **Natural Law and Enlightenment (17th-18th Centuries):**
    <br>   - **Natural Law:** Thinkers such as Hugo Grotius and John Locke contributed to the development of natural law theories, asserting that certain moral and legal principles are inherent in human nature.
    <br>   - **Enlightenment:** The Enlightenment era emphasized reason, individual rights, and skepticism of authority. Legal philosophers like Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Montesquieu explored ideas of legal positivism and the separation of powers.
    <br>
    <br>4. **Legal Positivism (19th Century):**
    <br>   - **Jeremy Bentham and John Austin:** Legal positivism gained prominence in the 19th century, with thinkers like Jeremy Bentham and John Austin emphasizing the importance of written law and the separation of law from morality.
    <br>
    <br>5. **Historical School (19th Century):**
    <br>   - Legal historians, such as Friedrich Carl von Savigny, focused on the historical development of legal systems. They argued that law should be understood within its historical and cultural context.
    <br>
    <br>6. **Sociological Jurisprudence (Late 19th-20th Centuries):**
    <br>   - **Emile Durkheim and Max Weber:** Sociological jurisprudence emerged, considering law as a social phenomenon. Emile Durkheim and Max Weber explored how social factors influence legal systems.
    <br>
    <br>7. **Realism (Early 20th Century):**
    <br>   - **Legal Realism:** Legal realism, prominent in the United States, challenged formalistic approaches and emphasized the role of judges' discretion and the impact of social and economic factors on legal decision-making.
    <br>
    <br>8. **Analytical Jurisprudence (20th Century):**
    <br>   - **H.L.A. Hart and the Positivist Response:** Analytical jurisprudence, exemplified by H.L.A. Hart, sought to refine legal positivism by acknowledging the importance of legal principles and rules.
    <br>
    <br>9. **Contemporary Trends (Late 20th Century - Present):**
    <br>   - **Critical Legal Studies:** This movement, emerging in the late 20th century, critiqued traditional legal theories and emphasized the political and economic dimensions of law.
    <br>   - **Feminist Jurisprudence:** Focuses on the role of gender in the law, addressing issues of equality, discrimination, and representation.
    <br>   - **Postmodern Jurisprudence:** Challenges the idea of a single, objective truth in law and highlights the role of language and power in legal interpretation.
    <br>
    <br>10. **Globalization and Interdisciplinary Approaches:**
    <br>    - Jurisprudence continues to evolve in response to globalization, technological advances, and interdisciplinary influences from fields like sociology, psychology, and economics.
    <br>
    <br>Jurisprudence remains a dynamic and evolving field, with scholars engaging in ongoing debates about the nature and purpose of law in contemporary societies. Different schools of thought continue to coexist, and new perspectives continually contribute to the rich tapestry of legal philosophy."

    <br>"Computational Law is the branch of legal informatics concerned with the automation of legal reasoning.[1][2] What distinguishes Computational Law systems from other instances of legal technology is their autonomy, i.e. the ability to answer legal questions without additional input from human legal experts.
    <br>While there are many possible applications of Computational Law, the primary focus of work in the field today is compliance management, i.e. the development and deployment of computer systems capable of assessing, facilitating, or enforcing compliance with rules and regulations. Some systems of this sort already exist. TurboTax is a good example. And the potential is particularly significant now due to recent technological advances – including the prevalence of the Internet in human interaction and the proliferation of embedded computer systems (such as smart phones, self-driving cars, and robots).
    <br>There are also applications that do not involve governmental laws. The regulations can just as well be the terms of contracts (e.g. delivery schedules, insurance covenants, real estate transactions, financial agreements).[3] They can be the policies of corporations (e.g. constraints on travel, expenditure reporting, pricing rules). They can even be the rules of games (embodied in computer game playing systems)."

    <br>"evolution of law:
    <br>The evolution of law is a complex and multifaceted process that has spanned centuries and varies across different cultures and legal systems. The development of law can be broadly categorized into several key stages:
    <br>
    <br>1. **Customary Law:** In early human societies, rules and norms were often based on customs and traditions. Disputes were resolved through informal processes within the community, and decisions were based on established practices.
    <br>
    <br>2. **Codification of Laws:** As societies grew more complex, there was a need for more formalized and systematic legal systems. Many ancient civilizations, such as the Babylonians, Egyptians, and Romans, began to codify laws into written statutes. The most famous example is the Code of Hammurabi, created in Babylon around 1754 BCE.
    <br>
    <br>3. **Religious Influence:** In many societies, religious texts played a significant role in shaping legal principles. For example, in ancient times, the Ten Commandments in the Judeo-Christian tradition and the Sharia law in Islamic societies influenced legal norms and practices.
    <br>
    <br>4. **Feudalism and Royal Courts:** In medieval Europe, feudalism brought about a decentralized legal system with local lords administering justice. Over time, monarchs began to centralize legal authority, establishing royal courts and a more uniform legal system.
    <br>
    <br>5. **Common Law and Civil Law Traditions:** The distinction between common law and civil law systems emerged. Common law, developed in England, relies on judicial precedent and the adversarial system, while civil law, derived from Roman law, is based on codified statutes and an inquisitorial system. Many legal systems around the world are influenced by one of these traditions.
    <br>
    <br>6. **Enlightenment and Legal Rationalism:** The Enlightenment era (17th to 18th centuries) marked a shift towards reason, individual rights, and legal rationalism. Thinkers like John Locke and Montesquieu influenced the development of constitutionalism and the separation of powers.
    <br>
    <br>7. **Human Rights and Modern Constitutionalism:** The 19th and 20th centuries saw the rise of human rights movements and the development of constitutional democracies. Documents like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) became influential in shaping legal norms globally.
    <br>
    <br>8. **Globalization and International Law:** In the contemporary era, globalization has led to increased interconnectedness between nations. International law has gained prominence, addressing issues that transcend national borders, such as human rights, environmental protection, and trade.
    <br>
    <br>9. **Technological Challenges:** The 21st century poses new challenges for legal systems, especially concerning technology, cybersecurity, privacy, and intellectual property. Legal frameworks are evolving to address these emerging issues.
    <br>
    <br>The evolution of law is an ongoing and dynamic process, shaped by social, political, economic, and technological changes. Legal systems continue to adapt to new challenges and reflect evolving societal values."

  <p id="idLaw020dsn">description::
    <br>"Primary sources of law are the formal and authoritative expressions of the law that are binding and enforceable. They are the original documents from which the law is derived and interpreted. Primary sources of law are typically created by government entities, such as legislatures, courts, and administrative agencies.
    <br>
    <br>**Examples of primary sources of law include:**
    <br>* **Constitutions:** The fundamental law of a country that establishes the framework for the government and enshrines fundamental rights and freedoms.
    <br>* **Statutes:** Laws enacted by the legislative branch of government, such as Congress or a state legislature.
    <br>* **Regulations:** Rules created by administrative agencies to implement and enforce statutes.
    <br>* **Court decisions:** Decisions by courts that interpret and apply the law to specific cases. These decisions become precedents that guide future cases.
    <br>* **Treaties:** International agreements between two or more countries that are binding on international law.
    <br>
    <br>Primary sources of law are distinguished from secondary sources of law, which are materials that provide information and commentary about the law. Secondary sources do not create law themselves, but they can be helpful in understanding and applying primary sources.
    <br>
    <br>Here is a table summarizing the key differences between primary and secondary sources of law:
    <br>| Feature | Primary Sources | Secondary Sources |
    <br>| Creation | Created by government entities | Created by legal scholars and practitioners |
    <br>| Authority | Binding and enforceable | Not binding or enforceable |
    <br>| Purpose | Provide the actual law | Explain, interpret, and analyze the law |
    <br>| Examples | Constitutions, statutes, regulations, court decisions, treaties | Legal encyclopedias, treatises, law review articles |
    <br>
    <br>Understanding the distinction between primary and secondary sources of law is essential for legal research and analysis. Primary sources are the foundation of the legal system, and they must be consulted to determine the applicable law in a given situation. Secondary sources can be helpful in understanding the context and meaning of primary sources, but they should not be relied upon as the definitive statement of the law."

    <br>"Computational law is a branch of legal informatics concerned with the mechanization of legal reasoning (whether done by humans or by computers).[1] It emphasizes explicit behavioural constraints and eschews implicit rules of conduct. Importantly, there is a commitment to a level of rigor in specifying laws that is sufficient to support entirely mechanical processing.
    <br>Philosophically, computational law sits within the Legal Formalist school of jurisprudence. Given its emphasis on rigorously specified laws, computational law is most applicable in civil law settings, where laws are taken more or less literally. It is less applicable to legal systems based on common law, which provides more scope for unspecified normative considerations. However, even in common law systems, computational law still has relevance in the case of categorical statutes and in settings where the handling of cases has resulted in de facto rules.
    <br>From a pragmatic perspective, computational law is important as the basis for computer systems capable of doing useful legal calculations, such as compliance checking, legal planning, regulatory analysis, and so forth. Some systems of this sort already exist.[2] TurboTax is a good example. And the potential is particularly significant now due to recent technological advances – including the prevalence of the Internet in human interaction and the proliferation of embedded computer systems (such as smart phones, self-driving cars, and robots)."

  <p id="idLaw011dsn">description::
    <br>· "A constitution is the aggregate of fundamental principles or established precedents that constitute the legal basis of a polity, organisation or other type of entity and commonly determine how that entity is to be governed.[1]
    <br>When these principles are written down into a single document or set of legal documents, those documents may be said to embody a written constitution; if they are encompassed in a single comprehensive document, it is said to embody a codified constitution. The Constitution of the United Kingdom is a notable example of an uncodified constitution; it is instead written in numerous fundamental Acts of a legislature, court cases, or treaties.[2]
    <br>Constitutions concern different levels of organizations, from sovereign countries to companies and unincorporated associations. A treaty that establishes an international organization is also its constitution, in that it would define how that organization is constituted. Within states, a constitution defines the principles upon which the state is based, the procedure in which laws are made and by whom. Some constitutions, especially codified constitutions, also act as limiters of state power, by establishing lines which a state's rulers cannot cross, such as fundamental rights.
    <br>The Constitution of India is the longest written constitution of any country in the world,[3] with 146,385 words[4] in its English-language version,[5] while the Constitution of Monaco is the shortest written constitution with 3,814 words.[6][4] The Constitution of San Marino might be the world's oldest active written constitution, since some of its core documents have been in operation since 1600, while the Constitution of the United States is the oldest active codified constitution. The historical life expectancy of a constitution since 1789 is approximately 19 years.[7]"

    <br>"Law is commonly understood as a system of rules that are created and enforced through social or governmental institutions to regulate conduct,[2] although its precise definition is a matter of longstanding debate.[3][4][5] It has been variously described as a science[6][7] and the art of justice.[8][9][10] State-enforced laws can be made by a collective legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes, by the executive through decrees and regulations, or established by judges through precedent, normally in common law jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people."

    <br>"law vs legal system:
    <br>"Law" and "legal system" are related concepts in the field of jurisprudence and governance, but they refer to different aspects of the legal framework within a society.
    <br>
    <br>1. Law:
    <br> - Definition: Law refers to a set of rules and regulations that are established and enforced by a governing authority (e.g., government or legislature) to regulate human behavior within a society or jurisdiction. These rules can cover a wide range of issues, including individual rights, obligations, responsibilities, and prohibitions.
    <br> - Characteristics:
    <br> - Laws can be written or unwritten (common law).
    <br> - They are designed to provide a framework for resolving disputes, maintaining order, and achieving justice.
    <br> - Laws can be divided into various categories, such as criminal law (dealing with offenses against the state), civil law (dealing with disputes between individuals or entities), and administrative law (governing government agencies).
    <br> - Sources of Law:
    <br> - Statutory law: Laws created by legislatures through the legislative process.
    <br> - Common law: Laws developed by courts through precedents and judicial decisions.
    <br> - Constitutional law: Fundamental laws that establish the framework of government.
    <br> - International law: Laws governing relations between countries.
    <br>
    <br>2. Legal System:
    <br> - Definition: A legal system is the overarching framework within which laws are created, interpreted, and enforced. It includes the institutions, processes, and mechanisms through which laws are applied and justice is administered within a specific jurisdiction.
    <br> - Characteristics:
    <br> - Legal systems can vary significantly from one country or region to another, reflecting cultural, historical, and political differences.
    <br> - They typically include key components such as the judiciary, legislative bodies, executive agencies, law enforcement, and legal professionals (lawyers and judges).
    <br> - Legal systems provide procedures for the resolution of disputes, the enforcement of laws, and the protection of rights.
    <br> - Types of Legal Systems:
    <br> - Common Law: Derived from judicial decisions and precedents, with a focus on case law.
    <br> - Civil Law: Based on codified statutes and comprehensive legal codes.
    <br> - Religious Law: Derived from religious texts and principles, often found in Islamic and some other religious societies.
    <br> - Customary Law: Evolves from long-standing cultural practices and traditions.
    <br> - Mixed Legal Systems: A combination of two or more of the above.
    <br>
    <br>In summary, "law" represents the rules and regulations that govern behavior, while the "legal system" encompasses the broader institutional framework for creating, interpreting, and enforcing those laws within a specific jurisdiction. Different countries and regions may have different legal systems and bodies of law, making the study of comparative law and legal systems an important field in understanding global legal diversity."

    <br>"legal system vs justice system:
    <br>The terms "legal system" and "justice system" are related but have distinct meanings:
    <br>
    <br>1. Legal System:
    <br> - The legal system refers to the set of laws, rules, regulations, and institutions that govern a society or jurisdiction. It encompasses the entire framework within which legal processes are established, interpreted, and enforced.
    <br> - The legal system includes legislative bodies that create laws, executive branches responsible for implementing and enforcing laws, and judicial branches that interpret and apply laws to resolve disputes.
    <br> - The legal system provides a structured and orderly way to address conflicts, regulate behavior, and ensure order in society. It is concerned with maintaining law and order, as well as upholding the rights and obligations of individuals and entities.
    <br>
    <br>2. Justice System:
    <br> - The justice system, on the other hand, is a subset of the legal system that specifically focuses on the administration of justice. It includes the courts, judges, lawyers, and other actors involved in the process of adjudicating legal disputes and ensuring that justice is served.
    <br> - The primary goal of the justice system is to ensure fairness, equity, and accountability in the application of laws. It is responsible for resolving disputes, punishing wrongdoers, and protecting the rights of individuals.
    <br> - The justice system plays a crucial role in upholding the rule of law and ensuring that individuals have access to a fair and impartial process when their rights are at stake.
    <br>
    <br>In summary, the legal system encompasses the entire framework of laws and institutions within a society, while the justice system is a component of the legal system that specifically deals with the administration of justice and the resolution of legal disputes. The justice system's ultimate aim is to ensure that justice is served and that individuals' rights are protected within the boundaries of the law."

    <br>The terms "justice system" and "judiciary" are related but refer to different aspects within the legal framework of a country:
    <br>
    <br>1. Judiciary:
    <br> - The judiciary is a specific component of the legal system that consists of courts, judges, and the legal professionals responsible for interpreting and applying the law. It is one of the three branches of government in many countries, alongside the legislative and executive branches.
    <br> - The judiciary's primary function is to adjudicate disputes, interpret laws, and ensure that justice is administered in accordance with the law. Judges within the judiciary are responsible for making legal decisions, rendering judgments, and upholding the rule of law.
    <br> - The judiciary plays a crucial role in safeguarding individual rights, resolving legal conflicts, and ensuring that the actions of the government and individuals are in compliance with the constitution and established laws.
    <br>
    <br>2. Justice System:
    <br> - The justice system is a broader term that encompasses not only the judiciary but also other components of the legal system, such as law enforcement agencies, prosecutors, defense attorneys, correctional facilities, and other entities involved in the administration of justice.
    <br> - While the judiciary focuses primarily on the resolution of disputes through the legal process, the justice system includes the entire process of maintaining law and order, enforcing laws, investigating and prosecuting crimes, and providing correctional and rehabilitation services for individuals who have been convicted of crimes.
    <br> - The justice system is concerned with ensuring that the principles of fairness, due process, and equality are upheld at all stages of the legal process, from law enforcement and investigation to trial and punishment.
    <br>
    <br>In summary, the judiciary is a specific part of the justice system, dealing primarily with the adjudication of legal disputes and the interpretation of laws. The justice system, on the other hand, is a more comprehensive term that encompasses the entire legal framework and its various components, including law enforcement, prosecution, defense, and corrections, all working together to maintain justice and order in society."

    <br>"judiciary definition:
    <br>The judiciary is the branch of government that is responsible for interpreting and applying the law. It is also known as the judicial system, judicature, judicial branch, judiciative branch, and court or judiciary system.
    <br>
    <br>The judiciary is responsible for adjudicating legal disputes, which means resolving them through a fair and impartial process. The judiciary also has the power to interpret the law, which means explaining what the law means and how it applies to specific cases. In some countries, the judiciary also has the power to strike down laws that it deems to be unconstitutional.
    <br>
    <br>The judiciary is an essential part of any democracy. It helps to ensure that the law is applied fairly and equally to everyone, and that the rights of all citizens are protected.
    <br>
    <br>Here are some of the key functions of the judiciary:
    <br>* To resolve legal disputes between individuals, groups, and organizations
    <br>* To interpret the law and apply it to specific cases
    <br>* To protect the rights of individuals and groups
    <br>* To ensure that the government and its officials act within the law
    <br>* To uphold the rule of law
    <br>
    <br>The judiciary is typically made up of a system of courts, each with a different level of jurisdiction. The highest court in a country is usually known as the supreme court. The supreme court has the final say on the interpretation of the law, and its decisions are binding on all lower courts.
    <br>
    <br>In many countries, the judiciary is independent of the other two branches of government: the legislative branch (which makes the laws) and the executive branch (which enforces the laws). This independence is essential to ensure that the judiciary can act impartially and without fear of pressure from the other branches of government.

    <br>The judiciary is an essential part of any democracy. It helps to ensure that the law is applied fairly and equally to everyone, and that the rights of all citizens are protected."

    <br>in its original meaning, it refers to the reason for the emergence of a legal provision, i.e. the motivation behind the creation of a legal construct. According to this definition, the ‘legal source’ of Union law is the will to preserve peace and create a better Europe through closer economic ties — two cornerstones of the EU.

    <br>"Jurisprudence or legal theory is the theoretical study of law. Scholars of jurisprudence seek to explain the nature of law in its most general form and provide a deeper understanding of legal reasoning, legal systems, legal institutions, and the role of law in society.[1]
    <br>Modern jurisprudence began in the 18th century and was focused on the first principles of natural law, civil law, and the law of nations.[2] General jurisprudence can be divided into categories both by the type of question scholars seek to answer and by the theories of jurisprudence, or schools of thought, regarding how those questions are best answered. Contemporary philosophy of law, which deals with general jurisprudence, addresses problems internal to law and legal systems and problems of law as a social institution that relates to the larger political and social context in which it exists.[3]"

    <br>"Legal informatics is an area within information science.
    <br>The American Library Association defines informatics as "the study of the structure and properties of information, as well as the application of technology to the organization, storage, retrieval, and dissemination of information." Legal informatics therefore, pertains to the application of informatics within the context of the legal environment and as such involves law-related organizations (e.g., law offices, courts, and law schools) and users of information and information technologies within these organizations.[1]"

    <br>"Computational Law is the branch of legal informatics concerned with the automation of legal reasoning.[1][2] What distinguishes Computational Law systems from other instances of legal technology is their autonomy, i.e. the ability to answer legal questions without additional input from human legal experts.
    <br>While there are many possible applications of Computational Law, the primary focus of work in the field today is compliance management, i.e. the development and deployment of computer systems capable of assessing, facilitating, or enforcing compliance with rules and regulations. Some systems of this sort already exist. TurboTax is a good example. And the potential is particularly significant now due to recent technological advances – including the prevalence of the Internet in human interaction and the proliferation of embedded computer systems (such as smart phones, self-driving cars, and robots).
    <br>There are also applications that do not involve governmental laws. The regulations can just as well be the terms of contracts (e.g. delivery schedules, insurance covenants, real estate transactions, financial agreements).[3] They can be the policies of corporations (e.g. constraints on travel, expenditure reporting, pricing rules). They can even be the rules of games (embodied in computer game playing systems)."

    <br>"As in most countries, the Greek legislative system publishes laws as documents often containing many references to precedent laws.

As a result, the assembly of all relevant modifications in order to consolidate the current version of a law may prove to be a tedious work when performed manually, requiring an increased cognitive effort."

    <br>"Computational law is a branch of legal informatics concerned with the mechanization of legal reasoning (whether done by humans or by computers).[1] It emphasizes explicit behavioural constraints and eschews implicit rules of conduct. Importantly, there is a commitment to a level of rigor in specifying laws that is sufficient to support entirely mechanical processing.
    <br>Philosophically, computational law sits within the Legal Formalist school of jurisprudence. Given its emphasis on rigorously specified laws, computational law is most applicable in civil law settings, where laws are taken more or less literally. It is less applicable to legal systems based on common law, which provides more scope for unspecified normative considerations. However, even in common law systems, computational law still has relevance in the case of categorical statutes and in settings where the handling of cases has resulted in de facto rules.
    <br>From a pragmatic perspective, computational law is important as the basis for computer systems capable of doing useful legal calculations, such as compliance checking, legal planning, regulatory analysis, and so forth. Some systems of this sort already exist.[2] TurboTax is a good example. And the potential is particularly significant now due to recent technological advances – including the prevalence of the Internet in human interaction and the proliferation of embedded computer systems (such as smart phones, self-driving cars, and robots)."

  <p id="idLaw011dsn">description::
    <br>· "A constitution is the aggregate of fundamental principles or established precedents that constitute the legal basis of a polity, organisation or other type of entity and commonly determine how that entity is to be governed.[1]
    <br>When these principles are written down into a single document or set of legal documents, those documents may be said to embody a written constitution; if they are encompassed in a single comprehensive document, it is said to embody a codified constitution. The Constitution of the United Kingdom is a notable example of an uncodified constitution; it is instead written in numerous fundamental Acts of a legislature, court cases, or treaties.[2]
    <br>Constitutions concern different levels of organizations, from sovereign countries to companies and unincorporated associations. A treaty that establishes an international organization is also its constitution, in that it would define how that organization is constituted. Within states, a constitution defines the principles upon which the state is based, the procedure in which laws are made and by whom. Some constitutions, especially codified constitutions, also act as limiters of state power, by establishing lines which a state's rulers cannot cross, such as fundamental rights.
    <br>The Constitution of India is the longest written constitution of any country in the world,[3] with 146,385 words[4] in its English-language version,[5] while the Constitution of Monaco is the shortest written constitution with 3,814 words.[6][4] The Constitution of San Marino might be the world's oldest active written constitution, since some of its core documents have been in operation since 1600, while the Constitution of the United States is the oldest active codified constitution. The historical life expectancy of a constitution since 1789 is approximately 19 years.[7]"

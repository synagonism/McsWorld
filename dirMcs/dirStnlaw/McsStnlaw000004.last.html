    <br>">international law:
    <br>International law is a set of rules and principles that govern the relationships between sovereign states and other international actors, such as international organizations and individuals. It is a complex and dynamic field that encompasses various legal frameworks, treaties, conventions, customary practices, and principles.
    <br>
    <br>Key elements of international law include:
    <br>1. **Sources of International Law:**
    <br>   - **Treaties:** Agreements between states that are binding under international law.
    <br>   - **Customary International Law:** Practices that have developed among states and are accepted as legally binding.
    <br>   - **General Principles of Law:** Legal principles common to various legal systems.
    <br>   - **Judicial Decisions and Scholarly Writings:** These are considered subsidiary sources of international law.
    <br>
    <br>2. **Subjects of International Law:**
    <br>   - **States:** The primary subjects of international law.
    <br>   - **International Organizations:** Entities like the United Nations, International Court of Justice, etc.
    <br>   - **Individuals:** Increasingly, individuals are recognized as having certain rights and responsibilities under international law.
    <br>
    <br>3. **State Sovereignty:**
    <br>   - The principle of state sovereignty is a fundamental aspect of international law, emphasizing the equality of states and their right to govern their internal affairs without external interference.
    <br>
    <br>4. **International Human Rights Law:**
    <br>   - Protects the rights and dignity of individuals globally. Key documents include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and various conventions.
    <br>
    <br>5. **International Humanitarian Law:**
    <br>   - Governs the conduct of armed conflict, aiming to protect civilians and combatants who are no longer taking part in hostilities.
    <br>
    <br>6. **International Environmental Law:**
    <br>   - Addresses global environmental challenges and promotes sustainable development.
    <br>
    <br>7. **International Criminal Law:**
    <br>   - Deals with crimes of an international concern, such as genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.
    <br>
    <br>8. **Use of Force and Peaceful Settlement of Disputes:**
    <br>   - The United Nations Charter regulates the use of force among states and promotes peaceful settlement of disputes.
    <br>
    <br>9. **International Courts and Tribunals:**
    <br>   - Entities like the International Court of Justice (ICJ) adjudicate disputes between states, while other tribunals focus on specific issues like trade or human rights.
    <br>
    <br>10. **Diplomatic and Consular Law:**
    <br>    - Regulates the conduct of states and their representatives in their diplomatic and consular relations.
    <br>
    <br>It's important to note that enforcement mechanisms in international law are often weaker compared to domestic legal systems. Compliance relies heavily on the willingness of states to adhere to their international obligations. The field continues to evolve as new challenges arise in the global community."

    <br>">subjects of international-law:
    <br>The subjects of international law are the entities that have the capacity to bear rights and obligations under international law. These entities include:
    <br>* **States:** States are the primary subjects of international law. They are defined as independent political entities that have control over a defined territory and population. States have the capacity to enter into treaties, to make war and peace, and to send and receive diplomatic representatives.
    <br>* **International organizations:** International organizations are entities that are created by states to cooperate on matters of common interest. These organizations can be either governmental or non-governmental. They have the capacity to enter into treaties, to make decisions that are binding on their member states, and to enjoy certain privileges and immunities.
    <br>* **Non-state entities:** Non-state entities are entities that are not states or international organizations. These entities can include individuals, corporations, and other legal entities. Non-state entities can have the capacity to bear rights and obligations under international law, but their capacity is generally more limited than that of states or international organizations. For example, individuals can be brought to trial for international crimes, but they cannot enter into treaties.
    <br>* **Special case entities:** Special case entities are entities that do not fit neatly into the categories of states, international organizations, or non-state entities. These entities can include the Holy See, the Order of Malta, and certain other entities that have been recognized as subjects of international law by the international community.
    <br>
    <br>The status of subjects of international law is important because it determines which entities can be held responsible for violations of international law. It also determines which entities can enjoy the rights and privileges that are protected by international law.
    <br>
    <br>The traditional view of the subjects of international law was that only states could be subjects of international law. However, in recent years, there has been a growing recognition that other entities, such as international organizations, non-state entities, and individuals, can also be subjects of international law. This recognition is reflected in the development of new bodies of international law, such as international human rights law and international criminal law.
    <br>
    <br>The development of the concept of the subjects of international law is an ongoing process. As the international community becomes more complex, new entities will emerge that may need to be recognized as subjects of international law."

    <br>">International-court-of-justice:
    <br>The International Court of Justice (ICJ), also known as the World Court, is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations (UN). It settles disputes between states in accordance with international law and gives advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by authorized United Nations organs and specialized agencies.
    <br>
    <br>**Jurisdiction**
    <br>The ICJ has jurisdiction to hear cases between states that have accepted its jurisdiction. States may accept the ICJ's jurisdiction by making a declaration under Article 36 of the ICJ Statute or by agreeing to its jurisdiction in a specific case. The ICJ may also hear cases between states that are parties to a treaty that provides for the settlement of disputes by the ICJ.
    <br>
    <br>**Procedure**
    <br>Cases before the ICJ are initiated by the filing of a written application with the Registry of the Court. The application must be filed by a state that is a party to the dispute. Once the application has been filed, the Registry of the Court sends a copy of it to the other state or states that are parties to the dispute. The other state or states then have a period of time to file a written reply to the application.
    <br>Once the pleadings have been exchanged, the ICJ may hold a hearing on the case. The hearing is an opportunity for the parties to present their arguments to the Court in person. The Court may also ask questions of the parties and their representatives.
    <br>After the hearing, the ICJ closes the case for deliberation. The Court then deliberates in private and reaches a decision by a majority vote. The decision of the Court is final and binding on the parties to the dispute.
    <br>
    <br>**Advisory opinions**
    <br>The ICJ may also give advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by authorized United Nations organs and specialized agencies. These opinions are not binding, but they are influential sources of international law.
    <br>
    <br>**The role of the ICJ**
    <br>The ICJ plays an important role in the international legal system. It is a court of last resort for states that are unable to resolve their disputes through other means. The ICJ's decisions help to develop and clarify international law. The Court's advisory opinions also provide guidance to the United Nations and its specialized agencies.
    <br>The ICJ is a permanent and independent court. Its judges are elected by the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council. The judges are independent of their governments and serve on the Court for a term of nine years.
    <br>The ICJ is located in The Hague, Netherlands. The Court's official languages are English and French.
    <br>
    <br>**Conclusion**
    <br>The ICJ is an important institution in the international legal system. It plays a vital role in the settlement of international disputes and the development of international law. The Court's work helps to promote peace and justice in the world.

    <br>">jurisdiction of International-Court-of-Justice
    <br>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. It is the only international court with jurisdiction over states to resolve legal disputes between them. The ICJ's jurisdiction is both contentious and advisory.
    <br>
    <br>**Contentious Jurisdiction**
    <br>The ICJ's contentious jurisdiction is exercised in accordance with international law and allows states to bring legal disputes against each other. There are two main ways for a state to refer a dispute to the ICJ:
    <br>1. **Voluntary submission:** A state can agree to submit a particular dispute to the ICJ by signing a special agreement, known as a compromis, with the other state involved in the dispute.
    <br>2. **Declarations under Article 36(2) of the Statute:** States may also make a declaration recognizing the compulsory jurisdiction of the ICJ for certain categories of disputes. This means that they agree to submit to the ICJ's jurisdiction without having to sign a special agreement each time a dispute arises.
    <br>The ICJ's contentious jurisdiction is limited to disputes between states. It cannot hear cases between individuals or non-state entities. Additionally, the ICJ's jurisdiction is based on consent, meaning that both parties to a dispute must agree to submit it to the Court for adjudication.
    <br>
    <br>**Advisory Jurisdiction**
    <br>The ICJ's advisory jurisdiction is exercised at the request of authorized United Nations organs or specialized agencies. The Court is asked to provide an opinion on legal questions that are relevant to the work of the requesting body. Advisory opinions are not binding, but they can be influential in shaping international law.
    <br>In order for the ICJ to exercise its advisory jurisdiction, the following conditions must be met:
    <br>1. **The requesting body must be authorized to make the request:** Only the Security Council, the General Assembly, and certain specialized agencies are authorized to request an advisory opinion from the ICJ.
    <br>2. **The question put to the ICJ must be of a legal nature:** The question must be capable of being resolved by the application of legal principles and rules.
    <br>3. **The question must not be of a political nature:** The question must not be primarily concerned with matters of policy or expediency.
    <br>4. **The question must not be one that the Court is not already seized of, or that the Court has already decided in a previous advisory opinion:** The Court will not provide an advisory opinion on a question that it has already ruled on, or that is pending before the Court in contentious proceedings.
    <br>The ICJ's advisory jurisdiction has been used to address a wide range of legal questions, including the interpretation of treaties, the legality of international acts, and the status of individuals in international law. Advisory opinions can be a valuable tool for clarifying international law and promoting its development.
    <br>
    <br>In summary, the International Court of Justice has two main types of jurisdiction: contentious and advisory. Contentious jurisdiction allows states to bring legal disputes against each other, while advisory jurisdiction allows the Court to provide opinions on legal questions at the request of authorized United Nations organs or specialized agencies."

    <br>">International-Criminal-Court:
    <br>The International Criminal Court (ICC) is the first and only permanent, treaty-based international criminal court that investigates and prosecutes individuals accused of the most serious crimes of international concern, namely genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression. The ICC is a court of last resort, meaning it can only intervene if national courts are unwilling or unable to genuinely prosecute these crimes.
    <br>
    <br>**Here are some of the key facts about the ICC:**
    <br>* **Established:** 2002
    <br>* **Headquarters:** The Hague, Netherlands
    <br>* **Number of member states:** 123
    <br>* **Jurisdiction:** The ICC can investigate and prosecute crimes committed on the territory of a member state, or by a national of a member state.
    <br>
    <br>**The ICC has investigated and prosecuted crimes in a number of countries, including:**
    <br>* **Africa:** Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan, Uganda, Central African Republic, Cτte d'Ivoire, Kenya, Mali, Libya, Burundi, and South Sudan
    <br>* **Asia:** Afghanistan, Iraq, Georgia, and the Philippines
    <br>* **Europe:** Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo, Georgia, and Ukraine
    <br>* **Americas:** Colombia, Guatemala, and Honduras
    <br>
    <br>**The ICC has faced a number of challenges, including:**
    <br>* **Limited cooperation from some states:** Some states, such as the United States, are not members of the ICC and have not cooperated with its investigations.
    <br>* **Resource constraints:** The ICC is a relatively new institution and has limited resources. This has made it difficult to investigate and prosecute all of the cases that it has been referred.
    <br>* **Lack of enforcement power:** The ICC does not have its own police force or prisons. It relies on member states to cooperate with its arrest warrants and to enforce its sentences.
    <br>
    <br>Despite these challenges, the ICC has made a significant contribution to the fight against impunity for the most serious crimes of international concern. It has brought justice to victims, deterred future crimes, and helped to strengthen the rule of law.

    <br>"The International Criminal Court (ICC or ICCt)[2] is an intergovernmental organization and international tribunal that sits in The Hague, Netherlands. The ICC is the first and only permanent international court with jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for the international crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression. It is intended to complement existing national judicial systems and it may therefore exercise its jurisdiction only when national courts are unwilling or unable to prosecute criminals. The ICC lacks universal territorial jurisdiction, and may only investigate and prosecute crimes committed within member states, crimes committed by nationals of member states, or crimes in situations referred to the Court by the United Nations Security Council.
    <br>The ICC began operations on 1 July 2002, upon the entry into force of the Rome Statute, a multilateral treaty that serves as the court's foundational and governing document. States which become party to the Rome Statute become members of the ICC, serving on the Assembly of States Parties, which administers the court. As of December 2020, there are 123 ICC member states; 42 states have neither signed nor become parties to the Rome Statute."

    <br>">evolution of international-criminal-court:
    <br>The evolution of the International Criminal Court (ICC) can be traced back to the atrocities committed during World War II, which sparked the establishment of the Nuremberg and Tokyo Tribunals. These tribunals, while groundbreaking in their own right, were ad hoc courts limited to specific conflicts and perpetrators. The desire for a permanent international criminal court emerged to address the most serious crimes of international concern, regardless of where or when they were committed.
    <br>
    <br>In 1948, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, marking a significant step towards establishing an international criminal justice system. However, the idea of a permanent ICC remained elusive for decades due to political and legal challenges.
    <br>
    <br>A breakthrough came in 1998 when 120 states adopted the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the legal basis for establishing the ICC. The Rome Statute defined the ICC's jurisdiction, powers, and procedures, and established the crimes that the ICC could prosecute.
    <br>
    <br>The ICC officially came into force on July 1, 2002, with 60 states becoming parties to the Rome Statute. Since then, the ICC has evolved into a crucial institution in the pursuit of international criminal justice.
    <br>
    <br>Key milestones in the evolution of the ICC include:
    <br>1. **Establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Establishment of an International Criminal Court (1995):** This committee was tasked with preparing a draft statute for an ICC, which eventually formed the basis for the Rome Statute.
    <br>
    <br>2. **Adoption of the Rome Statute (1998):** The adoption of the Rome Statute marked a major turning point, establishing the legal framework for the ICC.
    <br>
    <br>3. **Entry into force of the Rome Statute (2002):** With the ratification of the Rome Statute by 60 states, the ICC officially came into existence.
    <br>
    <br>4. **Opening of the ICC's headquarters in The Hague (2003):** The ICC established its permanent headquarters in The Hague, Netherlands.
    <br>
    <br>5. **Issuance of the first arrest warrant (2006):** The ICC issued its first arrest warrant for Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, a Congolese warlord accused of recruiting and using child soldiers.
    <br>
    <br>6. **First convictions (2012):** The ICC handed down its first convictions against Thomas Lubanga Dyilo and Germain Katanga, both Congolese warlords.
    <br>
    <br>7. **Opening of investigations in new regions (2015-present):** The ICC expanded its investigations to include situations in Latin America, Asia, and the Middle East.
    <br>
    <br>8. **Adoption of the crime of aggression (2017):** The ICC amended its Rome Statute to include the crime of aggression, a significant step in addressing the most serious crime under international law.
    <br>
    <br>The ICC continues to evolve, facing challenges and opportunities as it strives to fulfill its mandate of upholding international criminal justice. The court's ability to investigate and prosecute the most serious crimes of international concern, regardless of where or when they were committed, has set a precedent for international criminal justice.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInlenfmH2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idLawInlenfmdsn">description::
    <br>">enforcement of international-law:
    <br>The enforcement of international law is a complex and multifaceted issue. Unlike domestic law, which is enforced by a centralized authority with a monopoly on violence, international law is enforced through a decentralized system of self-help, cooperation, and institutions. This means that there is no single body or mechanism that is responsible for enforcing international law, and the effectiveness of enforcement varies depending on the specific norm, the parties involved, and the circumstances of the case.
    <br>**Self-help** is the most common method of enforcing international law. This means that states take action themselves to ensure that other states comply with international law. Self-help measures can be diplomatic, such as protest or suspension of relations, or they can be economic, such as sanctions or boycotts. In some cases, states may even resort to the use of force to enforce international law.
    <br>**Cooperation** is also an important factor in the enforcement of international law. States often work together to enforce international law through treaties, international organizations, and other multilateral mechanisms. For example, the United Nations Security Council can authorize the use of force to enforce international law, and the International Criminal Court can prosecute individuals for serious violations of international law.
    <br>**Institutions** play a crucial role in the enforcement of international law. These institutions can provide a forum for states to resolve disputes, monitor compliance with international law, and impose sanctions on states that violate international law. Some of the most important international institutions for the enforcement of international law include the International Court of Justice, the World Trade Organization, and the International Monetary Fund.
    <br>
    <br>The enforcement of international law is often challenging, but it is essential for maintaining a rules-based order in the international system. Without effective enforcement, international law would be nothing more than a set of empty promises.
    <br>
    <br>Here are some of the specific methods that are used to enforce international law:
    <br>* **Diplomatic measures:** These measures include protest, suspension of relations, and diplomatic isolation.
    <br>* **Economic measures:** These measures include sanctions, boycotts, and asset freezes.
    <br>* **Judicial measures:** These measures involve bringing cases against states or individuals who have violated international law.
    <br>* **Use of force:** This is a measure of last resort and is only authorized under international law in very limited circumstances.
    <br>
    <br>The effectiveness of international law enforcement varies depending on the specific norm, the parties involved, and the circumstances of the case. Some norms are more easily enforced than others, and states are more likely to comply with international law when they are powerful and have a strong interest in the norm being enforced.
    <br>
    <br>In recent years, there have been a number of initiatives to strengthen the enforcement of international law. These initiatives include the creation of new international courts and tribunals, the development of new enforcement mechanisms, and the increased use of sanctions and other punitive measures.
    <br>
    <br>Despite these efforts, the enforcement of international law remains a challenge. This is due to a number of factors, including the decentralized nature of the international system, the reluctance of states to use force, and the lack of a centralized enforcement authority. However, there is a growing recognition of the importance of international law, and there is a renewed commitment to strengthening its enforcement."

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInlevgFH1"></a></h1>
  <p id="idLawInlevgFdsn">description::
    <br>">evolution of international-law:
    <br>Sure, here is a summary of the evolution of international law:
    <br>
    <br>**Early Origins**
    <br>The roots of international law can be traced back to ancient civilizations, where treaties and customary practices governed interactions between states. However, it was in Europe that international law truly began to develop, driven by the need to manage relations between increasingly interconnected states.
    <br>
    <br>**Emergence of Modern International Law**
    <br>The Peace of Westphalia, concluded in 1648, marked a turning point in the development of international law. The treaty established the principle of state sovereignty, which laid the foundation for the modern international legal system.
    <br>
    <br>**Hugo Grotius and the Rise of Natural Law**
    <br>Hugo Grotius, a Dutch jurist, is widely considered the father of international law. His seminal work, "De Jure Belli ac Pacis" (On the Law of War and Peace), published in 1625, laid out the foundations of natural law, which posited that international law was derived from universal moral principles.
    <br>
    <br>**Positivism and the Rise of State Consent**
    <br>In the 19th century, positivism emerged as the dominant theory of international law. Positivists argued that international law was not based on natural law but rather on the consent of states. This shift reflected the growing importance of state sovereignty and the development of treaties as the primary source of international law.
    <br>
    <br>**The Hague Conventions and the Codification of International Law**
    <br>The Hague Conventions, held in 1899 and 1907, were a landmark in the codification of international law. The conventions addressed a range of issues, including the conduct of warfare and the protection of neutral states.
    <br>
    <br>**The League of Nations and the Rise of International Institutions**
    <br>The establishment of the League of Nations in 1920 marked a new era in international law. The League was the first permanent international organization dedicated to maintaining peace and security. It also played a role in codifying international law through conventions and treaties.
    <br>
    <br>**The United Nations and the Post-World War II Era**
    <br>The United Nations, established in 1945, replaced the League of Nations and became the central forum for international cooperation and lawmaking. The UN Charter enshrines key principles of international law, such as the prohibition of the use of force and the peaceful settlement of disputes.
    <br>
    <br>**Contemporary Developments in International Law**
    <br>International law has continued to evolve in the post-Cold War era, addressing new challenges such as globalization, environmental protection, and human rights. International institutions, such as the World Trade Organization and the International Criminal Court, have also emerged to play an increasingly important role in upholding international law.
    <br>
    <br>**Key Themes in the Evolution of International Law**
    <br>The evolution of international law has been shaped by several key themes:
    <br>* **Sovereignty:** The principle of state sovereignty has been central to the development of international law.
    <br>* **Consent:** The principle of state consent is the basis for the creation of international obligations.
    <br>* **Codification:** The codification of international law into treaties and conventions has provided greater clarity and certainty.
    <br>* **Institutionalization:** International institutions have played an increasingly important role in upholding international law.
    <br>* **Emerging Challenges:** International law is constantly evolving to address new challenges, such as globalization, environmental protection, and human rights.
    <br>
    <br>**Conclusion**
    <br>International law has played a crucial role in promoting cooperation, maintaining peace, and protecting human rights in the global arena. As the world continues to face complex and interconnected challenges, international law will remain an essential tool for managing relations between states and upholding the rule of law."

    <br>">evolution of international-law:
    <br>The evolution of international law is a complex and dynamic process that has taken place over centuries. It has been shaped by historical events, changes in state practices, and the development of new norms and institutions. Here is a brief overview of key stages in the evolution of international law:
    <br>
    <br>1. **Ancient and Medieval Periods (3000 BCE – 1648 CE):**
    <br>   - During ancient times, various civilizations had systems of customary laws governing relations between states and individuals.
    <br>   - In medieval Europe, the Catholic Church played a significant role in shaping laws and norms, particularly through the concept of "just war" and the idea of a natural law governing human conduct.
    <br>
    <br>2. **Peace of Westphalia (1648):**
    <br>   - The Peace of Westphalia is often considered a foundational moment for modern international law. It ended the Thirty Years' War and marked the beginning of the state-centric system.
    <br>   - The principle of state sovereignty emerged, emphasizing non-intervention in the domestic affairs of sovereign states.
    <br>
    <br>3. **18th and 19th Centuries:**
    <br>   - Emergence of the law of nations and the development of the idea of international legal personality for states.
    <br>   - The publication of legal scholars such as Emer de Vattel contributed to the codification and understanding of international law principles.
    <br>
    <br>4. **Hague Conferences (1899 and 1907):**
    <br>   - The conferences aimed to codify laws of war and establish the Permanent Court of Arbitration, reflecting a growing interest in international cooperation and dispute resolution.
    <br>
    <br>5. **League of Nations (1920):**
    <br>   - The League of Nations was the first international organization with the goal of maintaining peace and preventing conflicts.
    <br>   - It contributed to the development of international law through treaties and agreements.
    <br>
    <br>6. **Post-World War II Era:**
    <br>   - The United Nations (UN) was established in 1945, with its Charter serving as a foundational document of modern international law.
    <br>   - The Nuremberg Trials set important precedents for prosecuting individuals for war crimes and crimes against humanity.
    <br>
    <br>7. **Cold War and Decolonization:**
    <br>   - The Cold War era saw a focus on arms control and the development of treaties addressing issues such as nuclear weapons and the law of the sea.
    <br>   - Decolonization led to the creation of new states, influencing the development of international legal norms.
    <br>
    <br>8. **Contemporary Period:**
    <br>   - The end of the Cold War marked a shift in international relations, with increased emphasis on human rights, humanitarian intervention, and the responsibility to protect (R2P).
    <br>   - International criminal tribunals, such as the International Criminal Court (ICC), were established to prosecute individuals for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.
    <br>
    <br>9. **Globalization and New Challenges:**
    <br>   - Globalization has brought about new challenges, including issues related to the environment, cybersecurity, and transnational crime.
    <br>   - Efforts to address these challenges involve the development of new legal frameworks and mechanisms.
    <br>
    <br>The evolution of international law continues as the international community grapples with contemporary issues and strives to adapt legal norms to the changing global landscape. Ongoing developments include efforts to strengthen international institutions, enhance accountability, and address emerging threats to peace and security."

    <br>">international criminal law:
    <br>International criminal law is a branch of public international law that deals with the prosecution and punishment of individuals for international crimes. These crimes are considered to be of such serious nature that they are regarded as offenses against the international community as a whole. The key principles and institutions of international criminal law are designed to hold individuals accountable for acts that shock the conscience of humanity. Some of the primary international crimes include:
    <br>1. **Genocide:** Acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group.
    <br>2. **Crimes Against Humanity:** Widespread and systematic attacks directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack.
    <br>3. **War Crimes:** Violations of the laws and customs of war, including the mistreatment of prisoners of war, targeting civilians, and employing prohibited weapons.
    <br>4. **Aggression:** The act of initiating the use of armed force by one state against another state, in violation of the United Nations Charter.
    <br>
    <br>The establishment of international criminal law has evolved over time, and key developments include the Nuremberg and Tokyo Trials after World War II, the creation of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) in the 1990s, and the establishment of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in 2002.
    <br>
    <br>The International Criminal Court (ICC) is a permanent international court located in The Hague, Netherlands. It has the jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for the aforementioned international crimes, and it operates independently of the United Nations. The ICC is a treaty-based institution, and its jurisdiction is activated when national courts are unwilling or unable to prosecute these crimes.
    <br>
    <br>While international criminal law represents a significant advancement in holding individuals accountable for heinous acts, there are challenges, including issues related to jurisdiction, enforcement, and the political will of states to cooperate with international tribunals. Additionally, debates about the effectiveness and fairness of the ICC continue within the international community."

    <br>
    <br>">source of international-criminal-law:
    <br>International criminal law is a complex and evolving field that encompasses a set of legal principles and norms aimed at addressing and prosecuting individuals for serious international crimes. Several sources contribute to the development and establishment of international criminal law:
    <br>
    <br>1. **Treaties and Conventions:** International criminal law is often codified in treaties and conventions. Key documents include the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which established the ICC as a permanent international court to prosecute individuals for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression.
    <br>
    <br>2. **Customary International Law:** Customary international law arises from the consistent and general practice of states, accepted as law. Over time, certain principles related to international crimes have become customary law, reflecting the shared expectations and practices of the international community.
    <br>
    <br>3. **International Tribunals and Courts:** Ad hoc international criminal tribunals, such as the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), have played a significant role in shaping international criminal law. The decisions and judgments of these tribunals contribute to the development of legal precedents.
    <br>
    <br>4. **United Nations Resolutions:** The United Nations (UN) plays a crucial role in the development of international criminal law. UN resolutions and decisions often reflect the consensus of the international community on issues related to accountability for international crimes.
    <br>
    <br>5. **Customary Humanitarian Law:** International humanitarian law, also known as the law of armed conflict, governs the conduct of armed conflicts and includes provisions related to war crimes. Customary rules of humanitarian law have been established through state practice and are considered binding on all states.
    <br>
    <br>6. **Legal Scholars and Academia:** Legal scholars and academics contribute to the development and interpretation of international criminal law through their research, writings, and analysis. Their work helps shape legal opinions and influences the understanding of complex legal issues.
    <br>
    <br>7. **NGOs and Civil Society:** Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and civil society organizations play a role in advocating for accountability for international crimes. They often contribute to the development of legal norms, raise awareness, and monitor compliance with international legal standards.
    <br>
    <br>8. **National Legislation:** States may adopt domestic legislation to implement their international legal obligations related to international crimes. National laws can provide the basis for prosecuting individuals for offenses such as genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.
    <br>
    <br>These sources collectively contribute to the ongoing evolution and enforcement of international criminal law. The field continues to develop as new challenges arise, and the international community seeks to address emerging issues related to accountability and justice."

    <br>">diplomatic and consular law:
    <br>Diplomatic and consular law are two branches of international law that govern the conduct of states, diplomats, and consuls in their interactions with each other. These areas of law are crucial for maintaining international relations and facilitating communication and cooperation between countries. Here's a brief overview of each:
    <br>
    <br>1. **Diplomatic Law:**
    <br>   - **Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961):** This international treaty is the primary source of diplomatic law. It outlines the privileges and immunities granted to diplomats and diplomatic missions.
    <br>   - **Diplomatic Immunity:** Diplomats are granted certain immunities to ensure they can perform their duties without fear of harassment or interference. These immunities include personal inviolability, immunity from jurisdiction, and immunity from taxation.
    <br>   - **Diplomatic Privileges:** Diplomats also enjoy certain privileges, such as the right to communicate freely with their governments, the right to travel within the host country, and the inviolability of diplomatic premises.
    <br>
    <br>2. **Consular Law:**
    <br>   - **Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (1963):** Similar to the diplomatic convention, this treaty governs the establishment and conduct of consular relations between states. It defines the functions and privileges of consular officers.
    <br>   - **Consular Immunity:** While consular officers do not have the same level of immunity as diplomats, they still enjoy certain privileges and immunities to ensure the effective performance of their duties.
    <br>   - **Consular Functions:** Consuls are responsible for protecting the interests of their country's citizens in the host state, issuing visas and travel documents, promoting trade and economic relations, and providing various consular services.
    <br>
    <br>Key Concepts in Diplomatic and Consular Law:
    <br>- **Inviolability:** Diplomats and diplomatic premises are considered inviolable, meaning they cannot be violated or entered without permission.
    <br>- **Immunity:** Diplomats and consuls have various forms of immunity from legal jurisdiction and arrest to ensure they can perform their functions without fear of interference.
    <br>- **Reciprocity:** The principles of diplomatic and consular law often rely on the concept of reciprocity, where states grant similar privileges and immunities to each other's representatives.
    <br>- **Notification and Approval:** Host countries must be notified of the arrival of diplomatic or consular personnel, and approval is typically sought for the establishment of embassies or consulates.
    <br>
    <br>These legal frameworks help to ensure smooth diplomatic relations, protect diplomats and consuls, and facilitate international cooperation and communication. Violations of these laws can strain diplomatic relations and may lead to international disputes."

    <br>">international economic law:
    <br>International economic law (IEL) refers to the body of legal rules, principles, and norms that govern international economic relations among states, international organizations, and private entities. It encompasses a wide range of legal issues related to the global economy, including trade, investment, finance, intellectual property, and development. The primary goal of international economic law is to create a framework that facilitates the smooth functioning of the global economy while addressing the interests and concerns of different stakeholders.
    <br>
    <br>Key components of international economic law include:
    <br>
    <br>1. **International Trade Law:**
    <br>   - **WTO Law (World Trade Organization):** The WTO establishes rules for the conduct of trade between nations, providing a forum for negotiation and dispute resolution. It covers areas such as tariffs, non-tariff barriers, subsidies, and trade in services.
    <br>
    <br>2. **International Investment Law:**
    <br>   - **Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) and Multilateral Investment Treaties (MITs):** These agreements provide legal protection for foreign investors and their investments, often including provisions related to expropriation, dispute resolution mechanisms, and fair and equitable treatment.
    <br>
    <br>3. **International Finance Law:**
    <br>   - **International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank:** These international financial institutions play a significant role in shaping the global economic landscape. They provide financial assistance, policy advice, and technical assistance to member countries.
    <br>
    <br>4. **Intellectual Property Law:**
    <br>   - **Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS):** TRIPS is an agreement under the WTO that sets minimum standards for intellectual property protection, covering patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets.
    <br>
    <br>5. **Development Law:**
    <br>   - **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):** The promotion of sustainable development is a central concern in international economic law. Various agreements and initiatives aim to balance economic growth with social and environmental considerations.
    <br>
    <br>6. **Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs):**
    <br>   - **Examples include the European Union (EU) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA, now replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement or USMCA).** These agreements involve cooperation and integration on economic matters within specific regions.
    <br>
    <br>7. **Dispute Settlement Mechanisms:**
    <br>   - **WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB):** The WTO's dispute settlement system allows member states to resolve trade disputes through a structured and rule-based process.
    <br>
    <br>International economic law is dynamic and continually evolving, responding to changes in the global economic landscape and the needs of its participants. It involves a delicate balance between promoting economic growth, ensuring fair and equitable treatment, and addressing social and environmental concerns."

    <br>">environmental international-law:
    <br>International environmental law (IEL) is a body of law that governs the relationship between states and the environment. It is a relatively young field of law, having emerged in the 1970s in response to growing concerns about environmental degradation. IEL is a complex and evolving field of law, and it encompasses a wide range of issues, including climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, and the sustainable use of natural resources.
    <br>
    <br>**Sources of IEL**
    <br>There are three main sources of IEL:
    <br>* **International treaties:** Treaties are formal agreements between states that are binding under international law. There are hundreds of environmental treaties in existence, covering a wide range of issues. Some of the most important environmental treaties include the Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.
    <br>* **Customary international law:** Customary international law is a body of law that is based on long-standing state practice and opinio juris (the belief that the practice is legally binding). There are a number of customary international law principles that are relevant to IEL, such as the principle of state responsibility for environmental damage, the principle of prevention, and the precautionary principle.
    <br>* **Soft law:** Soft law is non-binding law that can still have a significant impact on IEL. Soft law can take a variety of forms, such as declarations, guidelines, and principles. Some of the most important examples of IEL soft law include the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development (1992) and the Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development (2002).
    <br>
    <br>**Principles of IEL**
    <br>IEL is based on a number of fundamental principles, including:
    <br>* **The precautionary principle:** The precautionary principle states that where there is a risk of serious or irreversible harm to the environment, action should be taken to avoid or minimize that harm, even if there is not yet scientific certainty that the harm will occur.
    <br>* **The principle of sustainable development:** Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
    <br>* **The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities:** The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities states that all states have a shared responsibility to protect the environment, but that developed states have a greater responsibility to do so, given their historical contributions to environmental damage and their greater capacity to pay for environmental protection.
    <br>
    <br>**IEL institutions**
    <br>* **The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP):** UNEP is the leading global environmental authority. It provides leadership and sets the global environmental agenda.
    <br>* **The United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development (UNCSD):** The UNCSD is a high-level intergovernmental body that reviews and promotes the implementation of Agenda 21, the global plan of action for sustainable development adopted at the 1992 Earth Summit.
    <br>* **The International Court of Justice (ICJ):** The ICJ is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. It has jurisdiction to settle legal disputes between states, including disputes relating to IEL.
    <br>
    <br>**IEL and the Anthropocene**
    <br>The Anthropocene is a geological epoch that is defined by the significant impact of human activities on the Earth's system. IEL is playing an increasingly important role in addressing the challenges of the Anthropocene, such as climate change and biodiversity loss.
    <br>
    <br>**Conclusion**
    <br>IEL is a complex and evolving field of law that is playing an increasingly important role in addressing the challenges of the Anthropocene. It is a critical tool for protecting the environment and ensuring sustainable development.

    <br>">human-rights international-law:
    <br>International human rights law is the body of international law that deals with the protection and promotion of human rights at the international, regional, and domestic levels. It is a complex and evolving field of law that draws on a variety of sources, including treaties, customary international law, general principles of law, and soft law.
    <br>
    <br>**The foundation of international human rights law is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR),** which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948. The UDHR is a non-binding declaration that sets out a broad range of civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights that all human beings are entitled to.
    <br>
    <br>**The UDHR has been supplemented by a number of other treaties,** including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). These treaties are binding on states that have ratified them, and they set out more detailed obligations for states to protect and promote human rights.
    <br>
    <br>**International human rights law also includes a number of customary international law norms,** which are rules of international law that are based on longstanding state practice and opinio juris (the belief that the rule is law). Customary international law norms include the prohibition of torture, genocide, and crimes against humanity.
    <br>
    <br>**In addition to treaties and customary international law, international human rights law also includes a number of soft law instruments,** such as declarations, resolutions, and guidelines. Soft law instruments are not binding on states, but they can still have a significant impact on the development of international human rights law.
    <br>
    <br>**International human rights law is enforced through a variety of mechanisms,** including international courts, tribunals, and human rights monitoring bodies. These mechanisms can investigate allegations of human rights violations and make recommendations to states to improve their human rights records.
    <br>
    <br>**International human rights law is a complex and evolving field of law, but it is also a vitally important one.** It plays a crucial role in protecting the human rights of all people, regardless of their nationality, race, gender, religion, or any other status.
    <br>
    <br>Here are some of the key principles of international human rights law:
    <br>* **Universality:** Human rights are universal, meaning that they apply to all people, everywhere, without discrimination.
    <br>* **Indivisibility:** Human rights are indivisible, meaning that they cannot be ranked or prioritized. All human rights are equally important.
    <br>* **Interdependence:** Human rights are interdependent, meaning that they are all interconnected and reinforce each other.
    <br>* **Non-discrimination:** All human beings are entitled to all human rights without discrimination on any grounds, such as race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.
    <br>* **Equality:** All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.
    <br>* **Accountability:** States are accountable for their actions or omissions in relation to human rights.

    <br>">sea international law:
    <br>The **law of the sea**, also known as the **maritime law**, is a body of customs, treaties, and international agreements that govern activities and legal relationships on the sea. It aims to establish order, maintain peaceful relations, and promote the sustainable use of marine resources.
    <br>
    <br>**Key principles of the law of the sea** include:
    <br>1. **Freedom of navigation:** All ships, regardless of their flag, have the right to innocent passage through territorial waters. This means that they can pass through these waters without stopping or communicating with the coastal state, as long as they do not engage in any activities that could threaten the peace and security of the coastal state.
    <br>2. **Exclusive economic zones (EEZs):** Coastal states have exclusive rights to explore, exploit, conserve, and manage the natural resources within their EEZs, which extend up to 200 nautical miles from their coastlines.
    <br>3. **Deep seabed resources:** The deep seabed, beyond national jurisdiction, is the common heritage of mankind. This means that its resources are owned by all of humanity and must be exploited for the benefit of all. The International Seabed Authority (ISA) was established to regulate the exploitation of deep seabed resources.
    <br>4. **Protection of the marine environment:** The law of the sea requires states to take measures to protect the marine environment from pollution and other harmful activities. This includes preventing marine pollution from ships, land-based sources, and atmospheric sources.
    <br>5. **Peaceful uses of the sea:** The law of the sea prohibits the use of the sea for hostile purposes, such as the threat or use of force. It also establishes rules for the settlement of maritime disputes.
    <br>
    <br>The **primary source of the law of the sea** is the **United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea** (UNCLOS), which was adopted in 1982 and entered into force in 1994. UNCLOS is the most comprehensive and widely accepted treaty on the law of the sea.
    <br>
    <br>In addition to UNCLOS, there are a number of other treaties and agreements that govern specific aspects of maritime law, such as fishing, conservation, and maritime transportation.
    <br>
    <br>The law of the sea is a dynamic and evolving field of law. As new uses are developed for the sea, and as the marine environment changes, the law of the sea must adapt to meet these new challenges.
    <br>
    <br>Here are some of the **recent developments in the law of the sea:**
    <br>* The increasing importance of **transboundary marine resources**, such as fish stocks and marine mammals, is leading to calls for greater international cooperation in their management.
    <br>* The growing problem of **marine pollution** is prompting states to adopt stricter regulations and enforcement measures.
    <br>* The development of new technologies, such as deep seabed mining, is raising concerns about the impact on the marine environment and the distribution of benefits.
    <br>
    <br>The law of the sea plays a crucial role in ensuring that the oceans are used sustainably and peacefully for the benefit of all humanity. As the world becomes more interconnected, the need for a strong and effective legal framework for the sea is becoming increasingly important."

    <br>"sources of international law of sea:
    <br>The sources of international law of the sea are the same as the sources of international law in general. These include:
    <br>
    <br>* **Treaty law:** Treaties are formal agreements between states that create legal obligations. The most important treaty in the law of the sea is the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which codifies and develops the law of the sea. UNCLOS has been ratified by 168 states and is considered to be customary international law.
    <br>* **Customary international law:** Customary international law is a rule of law that is established through long-standing state practice and opinio juris, which is the belief that the practice is legally binding. Customary international law is a subsidiary source of law, meaning that it only applies if there is no treaty law on the same subject matter.
    <br>* **General principles of law recognized by civilized nations:** General principles of law are fundamental principles of justice that are common to the legal systems of most states. These principles can be used to fill gaps in the law and to interpret treaty law and customary international law.
    <br>* **Judicial decisions:** The decisions of international courts and tribunals can also be a source of law, but they are not binding precedents.
    <br>* **Legal writings:** The writings of scholars can be a source of law, but they are not binding precedents.
    <br>
    <br>In addition to these traditional sources of law, there are a number of other sources that are important in the law of the sea. These include:
    <br>* **International organizations:** International organizations, such as the International Maritime Organization (IMO), play an important role in developing and implementing the law of the sea.
    <br>* **Soft law:** Soft law is non-binding law that can take a variety of forms, such as declarations, guidelines, and resolutions. Soft law can be a useful tool for developing new norms of behavior in the law of the sea.
    <br>* **State practice:** State practice is the way that states act in relation to the law of the sea. State practice can help to clarify the meaning of the law and to identify new norms of behavior."

    <br>">space international-law:
    <br>International space law, also known as space law, is a framework of international treaties and custom that governs the exploration, use, and protection of outer space. These laws were developed to ensure that space activities are conducted in a safe, responsible, and sustainable manner for the benefit of all humankind.
    <br>
    <br>**Key Principles of International Space Law**
    <br>* **Non-appropriation of outer space:** No country or entity may claim sovereignty over any part of outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies.
    <br>* **Peaceful use of outer space:** Outer space is to be used for peaceful purposes only, and the threat or use of force is prohibited.
    <br>* **Free access to all areas of celestial bodies:** All countries have the right to explore and use the Moon and other celestial bodies without discrimination.
    <br>* **Cooperation:** States are encouraged to cooperate in the exploration and use of outer space for the benefit of all.
    <br>* **Liability for damage caused by space objects:** States are responsible for any damage caused by their space objects in orbit or on the ground.
    <br>* **Protection of the environment:** States are responsible for preventing the contamination of outer space and celestial bodies.
    <br>
    <br>**Major International Space Treaties**
    <br>* **Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (Outer Space Treaty)**: This treaty, which entered into force in 1967, is the cornerstone of international space law. It establishes the basic principles of non-appropriation, peaceful use, and free access to outer space.
    <br>* **Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts, the Return of Astronauts and the Return of Objects Launched into Outer Space (Rescue Agreement)**: This treaty, which entered into force in 1968, provides for the rescue and return of astronauts and spacecraft in distress.
    <br>* **Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects (Liability Convention)**: This treaty, which entered into force in 1972, establishes a system of liability for damage caused by space objects.
    <br>* **Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space (Registration Convention)**: This treaty, which entered into force in 1975, requires states to register all space objects launched from their territory.
    <br>* **Moon Agreement:** This treaty, which has not yet entered into force, prohibits the militarization of the Moon and other celestial bodies and provides for the equitable sharing of resources extracted from these bodies.
    <br>
    <br>**Challenges in International Space Law**
    <br>As space exploration and technology advance, new challenges are emerging for international space law. These challenges include:
    <br>* **The commercialization of space:** The increasing involvement of private companies in space activities is raising questions about the application of international space law to these activities.
    <br>* **The exploration and exploitation of natural resources in outer space:** The potential for mining resources from asteroids and other celestial bodies is raising concerns about the equitable distribution of these resources and the environmental impact of their extraction.
    <br>* **The militarization of space:** The development of new weapons systems that could be used in space is a concern for many states and international organizations.
    <br>
    <br>International space law is constantly evolving as new challenges arise. The United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) is the main forum for international cooperation on space law. UNOOSA, the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs, provides administrative and technical support to COPUOS and other UN activities related to space law.
    <br>
    <br>The future of international space law is uncertain, but it is clear that it will play an increasingly important role in ensuring that space activities are conducted in a safe, responsible, and sustainable manner for the benefit of all humankind.

    <br>">state responsibility international-law:
    <br>State responsibility is a branch of international law that deals with the legal consequences of a state's breach of an international obligation. The principles of state responsibility are designed to ensure that states are held accountable for their actions and that victims of breaches are compensated for the harm they have suffered.
    <br>
    <br>**The Draft Articles on State Responsibility**, adopted by the International Law Commission (ILC) in 2001, are the most authoritative statement of the principles of state responsibility. The Articles define an internationally wrongful act as a conduct consisting of a breach of an international obligation by a state. The Articles also set out the conditions under which a state is responsible for an internationally wrongful act and the consequences of such an act.
    <br>
    <br>**The main principles of state responsibility are:**
    <br>* **Attribution:** A state is responsible for an internationally wrongful act only if the act is attributable to it. This means that the act must have been committed by the state or by a person or entity that is acting on the state's behalf.
    <br>* **Breach of an international obligation:** A state is responsible for an internationally wrongful act only if it breaches an international obligation. This means that the state must have a legal duty to act or refrain from acting in a certain way.
    <br>* **Injury:** A state is responsible for an internationally wrongful act only if the act causes injury to another state or to its nationals. This means that the act must have caused some harm or loss to the victim.
    <br>
    <br>**The consequences of an internationally wrongful act are:**
    <br>* **Cessation of the wrongful act:** The state responsible for the internationally wrongful act must cease the act if it is continuing.
    <br>* **Reparation:** The state responsible for the internationally wrongful act must make reparation for the injury caused by the act. This means that the state must compensate the victim for the harm or loss that it has suffered.
    <br>* **Satisfaction:** The state responsible for the internationally wrongful act must give satisfaction to the victim. This means that the state must acknowledge the breach and express regret for the harm caused.
    <br>
    <br>**The principles of state responsibility are important because they:**
    <br>* **Hold states accountable for their actions:** The principles ensure that states are not able to act with impunity and that they must take responsibility for their breaches of international law.
    <br>* **Protect the rights of states and their nationals:** The principles provide a framework for states to seek redress for breaches of international law and to compensate victims for the harm they have suffered.
    <br>* **Promote the rule of law:** The principles contribute to the development of a stable and orderly international legal system.
    <br>
    <br>**State responsibility is a complex and evolving area of international law. The principles of state responsibility are constantly being developed and refined by international courts and tribunals, by the ILC, and by scholars.**"

    <br>">international law of war:
    <br>International humanitarian law (IHL), also known as the law of armed conflict, is a body of law that regulates the conduct of hostilities and seeks to limit the suffering caused by armed conflict. IHL applies to all parties to an armed conflict, whether they are states or non-state actors.
    <br>
    <br>The main principles of IHL are:
    <br>* **Humanity:** Civilians and combatants who are no longer taking part in hostilities must be treated humanely. This means that they must not be killed, tortured, or subjected to other forms of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.
    <br>* **Distinction:** Civilians and civilian objects must be distinguished from combatants and military objectives. Attacks must be directed only at military objectives, and civilians must not be deliberately targeted.
    <br>* **Proportionality:** The expected military advantage of an attack must outweigh the expected civilian harm. Attacks that are likely to cause excessive civilian harm are prohibited.
    <br>* **Precautions in attack:** Parties to an armed conflict must take all feasible precautions to minimize civilian harm. This includes taking measures to avoid civilian casualties, such as giving advance warning of attacks.
    <br>
    <br>IHL is based on a number of treaties and conventions, including the Geneva Conventions, the Hague Conventions, and the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions. These treaties and conventions have been ratified by most countries in the world.
    <br>
    <br>IHL is enforced by a number of bodies, including the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the United Nations Security Council, and national courts. The ICRC is a humanitarian organization that works to protect the lives and dignity of people affected by armed conflict. The United Nations Security Council has the power to authorize the use of force and to impose sanctions on countries that violate IHL. National courts can prosecute individuals for war crimes, which are serious violations of IHL.
    <br>
    <br>IHL is an important tool for protecting civilians and limiting the suffering caused by armed conflict. It is a complex body of law, but it is essential for ensuring that armed conflicts are conducted in a humane manner."

    <br>">volume of International-law:
    <br>The volume of international law is difficult to quantify precisely, as it is a vast and ever-evolving body of law. However, it is estimated to be in the millions of pages. This includes treaties, customary international law, general principles of law, and judicial decisions.
    <br>
    <br>One way to measure the volume of international law is to look at the number of treaties that have been concluded. As of 2023, there are over 57,000 treaties in force, according to the United Nations Treaty Collection. These treaties cover a wide range of topics, including trade, human rights, environment, and disarmament.
    <br>
    <br>Another way to measure the volume of international law is to look at the number of cases that have been decided by international courts and tribunals. The International Court of Justice (ICJ), the primary judicial organ of the United Nations, has decided over 180 cases since its inception in 1946. Other international courts and tribunals, such as the European Court of Human Rights and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, have also decided a significant number of cases.
    <br>
    <br>The volume of international law is constantly growing, as new treaties are concluded, new customary international law norms are developed, and new judicial decisions are issued. This growth reflects the increasing complexity of the international legal system and the increasing importance of international law in the modern world."

    <br>">hard international-law:
    <br>In international law, hard law refers to legally binding rules that are enforceable by courts or other tribunals. Hard law is typically found in treaties, conventions, and other international agreements, as well as in customary international law.
    <br>
    <br>**Examples of hard international law:**
    <br>* The United Nations Charter
    <br>* The Geneva Conventions
    <br>* The Law of the Sea
    <br>* The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court
    <br>
    <br>**Characteristics of hard international law:**
    <br>* **Legally binding:** States are obligated to comply with hard international law.
    <br>* **Enforceable:** Hard international law can be enforced by courts or other tribunals.
    <br>* **Precise:** Hard international law is typically written in clear and precise language.
    <br>* **Public:** Hard international law is typically public and accessible to all states.
    <br>
    <br>**Benefits of hard international law:**
    <br>* **Predictability:** Hard international law provides predictability and certainty in international relations.
    <br>* **Accountability:** Hard international law promotes accountability by holding states accountable for their actions.
    <br>* **Cooperation:** Hard international law can promote cooperation among states by providing a common framework for action.
    <br>
    <br>**Challenges of hard international law:**
    <br>* **Enforcement:** Hard international law can be difficult to enforce, especially when states are unwilling to comply.
    <br>* **Flexibility:** Hard international law can be inflexible and difficult to adapt to changing circumstances.
    <br>* **Sovereignty:** Hard international law can be seen as a threat to state sovereignty.
    <br>
    <br>**Overall, hard international law is an important tool for promoting peace, justice, and cooperation in the world.**"

    <br>">soft international-law:
    <br>Soft law is a term used in international law to refer to non-binding international agreements, principles, and declarations. It is contrasted with hard law, which is binding on states. Soft law is often used to promote cooperation and coordination between states on issues of common concern, and to develop norms of behavior.
    <br>
    <br>Soft law can take a variety of forms, including:
    <br>* **Resolutions of international organizations:** Resolutions are adopted by international organizations, such as the United Nations General Assembly, and are not legally binding on states. However, resolutions can still have a significant impact on international law, as they can reflect the consensus of the international community on a particular issue.
    <br>* **Guidelines and principles:** Guidelines and principles are developed by international organizations or experts, and provide recommendations for state behavior. They are not legally binding, but they can still influence state practice.
    <br>* **Declarations:** Declarations are statements of political will or intent, and are not legally binding. However, declarations can still be important, as they can signal a state's commitment to a particular principle or policy.
    <br>
    <br>Soft law is often used in areas where there is no agreement on a binding rule of law. For example, soft law has been used to address issues such as human rights, environmental protection, and terrorism. Soft law can be a useful tool for developing new norms of behavior and for promoting cooperation between states.
    <br>
    <br>There are a number of advantages to using soft law:
    <br>* **Flexibility:** Soft law is more flexible than hard law, as it can be adapted to changing circumstances.
    <br>* **Speed:** Soft law can be developed and adopted more quickly than hard law.
    <br>* **Consensus-building:** Soft law can be used to build consensus among states on issues of common concern.
    <br>
    <br>However, there are also a number of disadvantages to using soft law:
    <br>* **Lack of enforceability:** Soft law is not legally binding, and states are not obliged to comply with it.
    <br>* **Ambiguity:** Soft law is often vague and ambiguous, which can make it difficult to interpret and apply.
    <br>* **Lack of legitimacy:** Soft law may not be seen as legitimate by all states, particularly those that were not involved in its development.
    <br>
    <br>Despite these disadvantages, soft law is a valuable tool for international law. It can be used to promote cooperation, coordination, and norm development among states."

    <br>"Customary international law is an aspect of international law involving the principle of custom. Along with general principles of law and treaties, custom is considered by the International Court of Justice, jurists, the United Nations, and its member states to be among the primary sources of international law.
    <br>Many governments accept in principle the existence of customary international law, although there are differing opinions as to what rules are contained in it.
    <br>In 1950, the International Law Commission listed the following sources as forms of evidence of customary international law: treaties, decisions of national and international courts, national legislation, opinions of national legal advisors, diplomatic correspondence, and practice of international organizations.[1] In 2018, the Commission adopted Conclusions on Identification of Customary International Law with commentaries.[2] The United Nations General Assembly welcomed the Conclusions and encouraged their widest possible dissemination.[3]"

    <br>">international treaty:
    <br>An **international treaty**, or **international agreement**, is a legal instrument that establishes a formal relationship between two or more states or international organizations. Treaties are governed by international law and are binding on the parties to the treaty. They are an important tool for regulating international relations and promoting cooperation among states.
    <br>
    <br>**Key characteristics of international treaties:**
    <br>* **Written form:** Treaties are typically written documents that are signed and ratified by the parties involved.
    <br>* **Governed by international law:** Treaties are subject to the rules of international law, which are set out in treaties and other international instruments.
    <br>* **Binding on the parties:** Treaties create legal obligations for the parties that are involved. These obligations must be fulfilled in good faith.
    <br>
    <br>**Types of international treaties:**
    <br>* **Multilateral treaties:** These treaties are between three or more states. For example, the United Nations Charter is a multilateral treaty.
    <br>* **Bilateral treaties:** These treaties are between two states. For example, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is a bilateral treaty.
    <br>
    <br>**Purposes of international treaties:**
    <br>* **Promote peace and security:** Treaties can help to prevent wars and resolve conflicts between states. For example, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is a treaty that aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.
    <br>* **Encourage cooperation:** Treaties can promote cooperation between states on a range of issues, such as trade, the environment, and human rights. For example, the Paris Agreement is a treaty that aims to address climate change.
    <br>* **Resolve disputes:** Treaties can provide a framework for resolving disputes between states. For example, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) is a court that can hear disputes between states that are based on treaties.
    <br>
    <br>**Examples of important international treaties:**
    <br>* **Treaty of Westphalia (1648):** This treaty ended the Thirty Years' War and established the modern system of sovereign states.
    <br>* **Convention on the Law of the Sea (1982):** This treaty governs the use of the oceans and establishes a legal framework for maritime navigation and resource exploitation.
    <br>* **Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948):** This declaration sets out the fundamental rights and freedoms that all people are entitled to.
    <br>* **Paris Agreement (2015):** This treaty aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels.
    <br>
    <br>**International treaties play a vital role in maintaining international peace and security, promoting cooperation and resolving disputes between states. They are an essential part of the international legal system and have a significant impact on the lives of people around the world.**

    <br>">volume of international-treaties:
    <br>The volume of international treaties has increased dramatically in recent years. According to the United Nations Treaty Collection, there were over 53,700 treaties and international agreements registered or filed and recorded as of April 2016. This represents a significant increase from the 1,500 treaties that were registered or filed and recorded in 1945.
    <br>
    <br>There are a number of factors that have contributed to the increase in the volume of international treaties. One factor is the increasing globalization of the world economy. As countries become more interconnected, there is a greater need for international cooperation and coordination. This has led to the negotiation of a growing number of treaties on a wide range of topics, such as trade, investment, and environmental protection.
    <br>
    <br>Another factor that has contributed to the increase in the volume of international treaties is the proliferation of international organizations. There are now over 5,000 international organizations, each of which has the capacity to negotiate and adopt treaties. These organizations cover a wide range of areas, such as health, education, and human rights.
    <br>
    <br>The increase in the volume of international treaties has a number of implications. One implication is that it is becoming increasingly difficult for states to keep track of all of the treaties that they are party to. This can lead to problems with compliance and implementation.
    <br>
    <br>Another implication is that the growing complexity of the international legal system is making it more difficult for states to resolve disputes peacefully. This is because there are now a multitude of treaties and international organizations that can be involved in any given dispute.
    <br>
    <br>Overall, the increase in the volume of international treaties is a reflection of the growing interconnectedness of the world. However, it also poses a number of challenges for states and international organizations."

    <br>">Hague-conventions:
    <br>The Hague Conventions are a series of multilateral treaties and declarations negotiated at two international peace conferences held at The Hague in the Netherlands in 1899 and 1907. The conventions codified the laws and customs of war, making them the first comprehensive attempt to regulate armed conflict.
    <br>
    <br>The conventions established a number of important principles, including:
    <br>* The obligation to distinguish between combatants and non-combatants
    <br>* The prohibition of indiscriminate attacks
    <br>* The protection of civilians and civilian objects
    <br>* The treatment of prisoners of war
    <br>* The prohibition of certain weapons
    <br>
    <br>The Hague Conventions have been widely ratified and have become part of customary international law. They have been instrumental in preventing the escalation of violence and protecting civilians during armed conflicts.
    <br>Here are some of the key Hague Conventions:
    <br>* **Hague Convention (I) for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes (1899)**: This convention established the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the first international court for the peaceful settlement of disputes.
    <br>* **Hague Convention (II) for the Reduction of Armaments** (1899): This convention called for the limitation of the size of armies and navies.
    <br>* **Hague Convention (III) on the Opening of Hostilities** (1899 and 1907): This convention specifies the formal declaration of war and bans surprise attacks.
    <br>* **Hague Convention (IV) on the Laws and Customs of War on Land** (1899 and 1907): This convention establishes rules governing the conduct of hostilities on land, including the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks, the protection of civilians and civilian objects, and the treatment of prisoners of war.
    <br>* **Hague Convention (VI) on the Status of Enemy Merchant Ships at the Outbreak of Hostilities** (1907): This convention provides for the protection of merchant ships belonging to belligerents from capture by the enemy during the first two weeks of a war.
    <br>* **Hague Convention (IX) on Bombardment by Naval Forces in Time of War** (1907): This convention restricts the use of naval bombardment against coastal towns and villages, requiring that such attacks be directed against military objectives.
    <br>
    <br>The Hague Conventions have been instrumental in promoting international cooperation and preventing the escalation of violence. They remain of great importance today, as they provide a framework for regulating armed conflict and protecting civilians."

    <br>">Geneva conventions:
    <br>The Geneva Conventions are a series of four international treaties and three additional protocols that establish international legal standards for humanitarian treatment in war. They were first adopted in 1864, and have been revised and expanded several times since then. The Geneva Conventions apply in all international and non-international armed conflicts, and they protect people who are not taking part in the hostilities (civilians, medics, and aid workers), as well as those who are no longer participating in the hostilities, such as wounded, sick, and shipwrecked soldiers and prisoners of war.
    <br>
    <br>**Key Principles of the Geneva Conventions**
    <br>* **Humanity:** The Geneva Conventions are based on the principle of humanity, which means that they aim to protect the lives and dignity of individuals during armed conflict.
    <br>* **Impartiality:** The Geneva Conventions must be applied impartially, without discrimination of any kind, such as race, color, religion, sex, birth, or wealth.
    <br>* **Neutrality:** The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the leading organization responsible for upholding the Geneva Conventions, must remain neutral in all its activities.
    <br>
    <br>**Protections Under the Geneva Conventions**
    <br>The Geneva Conventions provide a range of protections for people affected by armed conflict, including:
    <br>* **Protection from violence and abuse:** Civilians, medical personnel, and aid workers must be protected from violence and abuse, including torture, cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.
    <br>* **Access to medical care:** All wounded and sick people, without distinction, must be given access to medical care.
    <br>* **Preservation of cultural property:** Cultural property, such as museums, libraries, and religious buildings, must be protected from destruction or damage.
    <br>* **Repatriation of prisoners of war:** Prisoners of war must be released and repatriated at the end of hostilities.
    <br>
    <br>**Challenges to Implementing the Geneva Conventions**
    <br>Despite their importance, the Geneva Conventions face a number of challenges in being implemented fully. These challenges include:
    <br>* **Violations of the Conventions:** Parties to armed conflicts often violate the Geneva Conventions, either intentionally or unintentionally.
    <br>* **Lack of accountability:** There is often a lack of accountability for violations of the Geneva Conventions, which makes it difficult to deter future violations.
    <br>* **Difficulties in accessing conflict zones:** It can be difficult for humanitarian organizations to access conflict zones to provide assistance to those who need it.
    <br>
    <br>Despite these challenges, the Geneva Conventions remain an essential framework for protecting human life and dignity during armed conflict. They are an important reminder that even in the midst of war, there are basic standards of humanity that must be upheld.

    <br>">international convention vs treaty:
    <br>The terms "international convention" and "treaty" are often used interchangeably, but there is a subtle difference between the two.
    <br>
    <br>**Legally, there is no difference between an international convention and a treaty.** Both are legally binding agreements between states that are governed by international law. They are entered into for a variety of purposes, such as regulating international trade, establishing diplomatic relations, or protecting human rights.
    <br>
    <br>**The main difference between the two terms is that "convention" is typically used for formal multilateral treaties with a broad number of parties, while "treaty" is a more general term that can be used for any kind of international agreement, regardless of the number of parties involved.** For example, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is a multilateral treaty with 168 parties, while the Paris Agreement on climate change is a multilateral treaty with 196 parties.
    <br>
    <br>In practice, the terms "convention" and "treaty" are often used interchangeably, and there is no need to be pedantic about which term to use. However, if you are writing a formal document, it is always best to use the term that is most appropriate for the context.
    <br>
    <br>Here is a table summarizing the key differences between international conventions and treaties:
    <br>| Feature | International Convention | Treaty |
    <br>| **Used for** | Formal multilateral treaties with a broad number of parties | Any kind of international agreement, regardless of the number of parties involved |
    <br>| **Tendency** | Used for treaties that deal with important or sensitive issues | Used for all types of treaties |
    <br>| **Examples** | United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea | Paris Agreement on climate change |"

  <p id="idLawInl003dsn">description::
    <br>">general principles of international-law:
    <br>General principles of international law are fundamental norms that are recognized and accepted by the international community of states. They are considered to be part of customary international law, which is a source of international law that is based on long-standing and generally accepted practices of states. General principles of international law are often used to fill gaps in the law or to interpret other sources of international law.
    <br>
    <br>Some of the most important general principles of international law include:
    <br>* **Sovereign equality of states:** All states are equal and independent, and no state has the right to interfere in the internal affairs of another state.
    <br>* **Pacta sunt servanda:** Treaties must be observed in good faith.
    <br>* **Nullus crimen sine lege:** There is no crime without law.
    <br>* **Aut in deroga aut non:** A state cannot rely on its own internal law to justify a breach of international law.
    <br>* **Res judicata:** A matter that has been judicially decided cannot be relitigated.
    <br>* **Estoppel:** A state is bound by its own representations.
    <br>* **Good faith:** States must act in good faith in their relations with other states.
    <br>* **Equity:** States must act in a fair and equitable manner.
    <br>* **Justice:** States must uphold justice in their relations with other states.
    <br>
    <br>General principles of international law are an important source of international law and are used to promote the rule of law in the international system. They provide a framework for states to interact with each other in a peaceful and cooperative manner.
    <br>
    <br>Here are some examples of how general principles of international law have been applied:
    <br>* In the case of the *Interhandel Case*, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) held that the principle of pacta sunt servanda required Switzerland to comply with a treaty it had signed with the United States, even though the Swiss Federal Council had declared the treaty null and void.
    <br>* In the case of the *Fisheries Jurisdiction Case*, the ICJ held that the principle of good faith required Iceland to negotiate with the United Kingdom in order to reach an agreement on fishing quotas, even though Iceland had not violated any specific international law provision.
    <br>* In the case of the *Oil Platforms Case*, the ICJ held that the principle of estoppel prevented Iran from relying on its own internal law to justify its seizure of oil platforms owned by the United States.
    <br>
    <br>General principles of international law are a dynamic and evolving source of international law. They are constantly being developed and refined by the international community of states."

    <br>">judicial-dicisions of international-law:
    <br>Judicial decisions play a significant role in international law, serving as a secondary source of law and providing valuable insights into the interpretation and application of international legal norms. While not formally binding on subsequent disputes, judicial decisions are often persuasive and can shape the development of international law in various ways.
    <br>
    <br>**Primary and Secondary Sources of International Law**
    <br>International law is primarily derived from treaties, customary international law, and general principles of law. These sources are considered primary sources, as they directly establish legal norms. Judicial decisions, on the other hand, are categorized as secondary sources, meaning they interpret and apply primary sources to specific cases.
    <br>
    <br>**Role of Judicial Decisions in International Law**
    <br>Despite their secondary status, judicial decisions hold considerable influence in international law. They serve several key functions:
    <br>1. **Evidence of Customary International Law:** Judicial decisions can provide evidence of state practice, opinio juris (belief in the legal bindingness of a norm), and the general acceptance of a customary rule.
    <br>2. **Interpretation of Treaties:** Courts and tribunals play a crucial role in interpreting treaty provisions, resolving ambiguities, and determining the scope of treaty obligations.
    <br>3. **Development of International Law:** Judicial decisions can contribute to the development of international law by identifying new legal principles, expanding the scope of existing norms, and refining the interpretation of international legal instruments.
    <br>
    <br>**Persuasive Value of Judicial Decisions**
    <br>The persuasive value of judicial decisions varies depending on the court or tribunal issuing the decision, the quality of its reasoning, and the consistency with other judicial decisions. Decisions from courts with higher authority, such as the International Court of Justice (ICJ), carry greater weight than those from lower courts or specialized tribunals.
    <br>
    <br>**Stare Decisis in International Law**
    <br>Unlike national legal systems that adhere to the principle of stare decisis, which requires courts to follow precedents set by higher courts, international law does not have a formal doctrine of stare decisis. However, courts and tribunals often give significant deference to the decisions of higher courts and influential tribunals, particularly when they address similar legal issues.
    <br>
    <br>**Impact of Judicial Decisions**
    <br>Judicial decisions can have a significant impact on the international legal landscape, affecting the behavior of states, influencing the interpretation of international legal norms, and shaping the development of international law. While not formally binding, judicial decisions often set precedents, guide state practice, and contribute to the overall evolution of international law."

  <p id="idLawInl017dsn">description::
    <br>"The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), also called the Law of the Sea Convention or the Law of the Sea Treaty, is an international agreement that establishes a legal framework for all marine and maritime activities. As of May 2023, 168 countries and the European Union are parties.
    <br>
    <br>The convention resulted from the third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III), which took place between 1973 and 1982. UNCLOS replaced the four treaties of the 1958 Convention on the High Seas. UNCLOS came into force in 1994, a year after Guyana became the 60th nation to ratify the treaty.[1] In 2023, agreement was reached on a High Seas Treaty to be added as an instrument of the convention, to protect ocean life in international waters. This would provide measures including Marine Protected Areas and environmental impact assessments.
    <br>
    <br>While the secretary-general of the United Nations receives instruments of ratification and accession and the UN provides support for meetings of states party to the convention, the United Nations Secretariat has no direct operational role in the implementation of the convention. A UN specialized agency, the International Maritime Organization, does play a role, however, as well as other bodies such as the International Whaling Commission and the International Seabed Authority (ISA), which was established by the convention itself."

  <p><i>Prompted</i> by the desire to settle, in a spirit of mutual understanding and cooperation, all issues relating to the law of the sea and aware of the historic significance of this Convention as an important contribution to the maintenance of peace, justice and progress for all peoples of the world,
    </p>
  <p><i>Noting</i> that developments since the United Nations Conferences on the Law of the Sea held at Geneva in 1958 and 1960 have accentuated the need for a new and generally acceptable Convention on the law of the sea,
    </p>
  <p><i>Conscious</i> that the problems of ocean space are closely interrelated and need to be considered as a whole,
    </p>
  <p><i>Recognizing</i> the desirability of establishing through this Convention, with due regard for the sovereignty of all States, a legal order for the seas and oceans which will facilitate international communication, and will promote the peaceful uses of the seas and oceans, the equitable and efficient utilization of their resources, the conservation of their living resources, and the study, protection and preservation of the marine environment,
    </p>
  <p><i>Bearing in mind</i> that the achievement of these goals will contribute to the realization of a just and equitable international economic order which takes into account the interests and needs of mankind as a whole and, in particular, the special interests and needs of developing countries, whether coastal or land-locked,
    </p>
  <p><i>Desiring</i> by this Convention to develop the principles embodied in resolution 2749 (XXV) of 17 December 1970 in which the General Assembly of the United Nations solemnly declared <i>inter alia</i> that the area of the seabed and ocean floor and the subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, as well as its resources, are the common heritage of mankind, the exploration and exploitation of which shall be carried out for the benefit of mankind as a whole, irrespective of the geographical location of States,
    </p>
  <p><i>Believing</i> that the codification and progressive development of the law of the sea achieved in this Convention will contribute to the strengthening of peace, security, cooperation and friendly relations among all nations in conformity with the principles of justice and equal rights and will promote the economic and social advancement of all peoples of the world, in accordance with the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations as set forth in the Charter,

  <p id="idLawInl017A7P1">7.1. In localities where the coastline is deeply indented and cut into, or if there is a fringe of islands along the coast in its immediate vicinity, the method of straight baselines joining appropriate points may be employed in drawing the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A7P1"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl017A7P2">7.2.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A7P2"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl017A7P3">7.3. The drawing of straight baselines must not depart to any appreciable extent from the general direction of the coast, and the sea areas lying within the lines must be sufficiently closely linked to the land domain to be subject to the regime of internal waters.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A7P3"></a></p>

An indentation shall not, however, be regarded as a bay unless its area is as large as, or larger than, that of the semi-circle whose diameter is a line drawn across the mouth of that indentation.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A10P2"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl017A10P3">10.3. For the purpose of measurement, the area of an indentation is that lying between the low-water mark around the shore of the indentation and a line joining the low-water mark of its natural entrance points.  Where, because of the presence of islands, an indentation has more than one mouth, the semi-circle shall be drawn on a line as long as the sum total of the lengths of the lines across the different mouths.  Islands within an indentation shall be included as if they were part of the water area of the indentation.

  <p id="idLawInl017A111P1">111.1. The hot pursuit of a foreign ship may be undertaken when the competent authorities of the coastal State have good reason to believe that the ship has violated the laws and regulations of that State.  Such pursuit must be commenced when the foreign ship or one of its boats is within the internal waters, the archipelagic waters, the territorial sea or the contiguous zone of the pursuing State, and may only be continued outside the territorial sea or the contiguous zone if the pursuit has not been interrupted.  It is not necessary that, at the time when the foreign ship within the territorial sea or the contiguous zone receives the order to stop, the ship giving the order should likewise be within the territorial sea or the contiguous zone.  If the foreign ship is within a contiguous zone, as defined in article 33, the pursuit may only be undertaken if there has been a violation of the rights for the protection of which the zone was established.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A111P1"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl017A111P2">111.2.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A111P2"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl017A111P3">111.3. The right of hot pursuit ceases as soon as the ship pursued enters the territorial sea of its own State or of a third State.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A111P3"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl017A111P4">111.4. Hot pursuit is not deemed to have begun unless the pursuing ship has satisfied itself by such practicable means as may be available that the ship pursued or one of its boats or other craft working as a team and using the ship pursued as a mother ship is within the limits of the territorial sea, or, as the case may be, within the contiguous zone or the exclusive economic zone or above the continental shelf.  The pursuit may only be commenced after a visual or auditory signal to stop has been given at a distance which enables it to be seen or heard by the foreign ship.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A111P4"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl017A111P5">111.5. The right of hot pursuit may be exercised only by warships or military aircraft, or other ships or aircraft clearly marked and identifiable as being on government service and authorized to that effect.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A111P5"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl017A111P6">111.6. Where hot pursuit is effected by an aircraft:
    <br>
    <br>(a) the provisions of paragraphs 1 to 4 shall apply<i> mutatis mutandis</i>;
    <br>
    <br>(b) the aircraft giving the order to stop must itself actively pursue the ship until a ship or another aircraft of the coastal State, summoned by the aircraft, arrives to take over the pursuit, unless the aircraft is itself able to arrest the ship.  It does not suffice to justify an arrest outside the territorial sea that the ship was merely sighted by the aircraft as an offender or suspected offender, if it was not both ordered to stop and pursued by the aircraft itself or other aircraft or ships which continue the pursuit without interruption.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A111P6"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl017A111P7">111.7. The release of a ship arrested within the jurisdiction of a State and escorted to a port of that State for the purposes of an inquiry before the competent authorities may not be claimed solely on the ground that the ship, in the course of its voyage, was escorted across a portion of the exclusive economic zone or the high seas, if the circumstances rendered this necessary.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A111P7"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl017A111P8">111.8. Where a ship has been stopped or arrested outside the territorial sea in circumstances which do not justify the exercise of the right of hot pursuit, it shall be compensated for any loss or damage that may have been thereby sustained.

    <br>(ii) sixty per cent of the difference between the trend line values for nickel consumption, as calculated pursuant to subparagraph (b), for the year for which the production authorization is being applied for and the year immediately prior to the year of the earliest commercial production.
    <br>
    <br>(b) For the purposes of subparagraph (a):
    <br>(i) trend line values used for computing the nickel production ceiling shall be those annual nickel consumption values on a trend line computed during the year in which a production authorization is issued.  The trend line shall be derived from a linear regression of the logarithms of actual nickel consumption for the most recent 15-year period for which such data are available, time being the independent variable.  This trend line shall be referred to as the original trend line;
    <br>(ii) if the annual rate of increase of the original trend line is less than 3 per cent, then the trend line used to determine the quantities referred to in subparagraph (a) shall instead be one passing through the original trend line at the value for the first year of the relevant 15-year period, and increasing at 3 per cent annually; provided however that the production ceiling established for any year of the interim period may not in any case exceed the difference between the original trend line value for that year and the original trend line value for the year immediately prior to the commencement of the interim period.

    <br>(a) An operator may in any year produce less than or up to 8 per cent more than the level of annual production of minerals from polymetallic nodules specified in his production authorization, provided that the over-all amount of production shall not exceed that specified in the authorization.  Any excess over 8 per cent and up to 20 per cent in any year, or any excess in the first and subsequent years following two consecutive years in which excesses occur, shall be negotiated with the Authority, which may require the operator to obtain a supplementary production authorization to cover additional production.
    <br>
    <br>(b) Applications for such supplementary production authorizations shall be considered by the Authority only after all pending applications by operators who have not yet received production authorizations have been acted upon and due account has been taken of other likely applicants.  The Authority shall be guided by the principle of not exceeding the total production allowed under the production ceiling in any year of the interim period.  It shall not authorize the production under any plan of work of a quantity in excess of 46,500 metric tonnes of nickel per year.

  <p id="idLawInl017A151P9">151.9. The Authority shall have the power to limit the level of production of minerals from the Area, other than minerals from polymetallic nodules, under such conditions and applying such methods as may be appropriate by adopting regulations in accordance with article 161, paragraph 8.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A151P9"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl017A151P10">151.10. Upon the recommendation of the Council on the basis of advice from the Economic Planning Commission, the Assembly shall establish a system of compensation or take other measures of economic adjustment assistance including cooperation with specialized agencies and other international organizations to assist developing countries which suffer serious adverse effects on their export earnings or economies resulting from a reduction in the price of an affected mineral or in the volume of exports of that mineral, to the extent that such reduction is caused by activities in the Area.  The Authority on request shall initiate studies on the problems of those States which are likely to be most seriously affected with a view to minimizing their difficulties and assisting them in their economic adjustment.

Within 45 days of receiving such data, the Authority shall designate which part is to be reserved solely for the conduct of activities by the Authority through the Enterprise or in association with developing States.  This designation may be deferred for a further period of 45 days if the Authority requests an independent expert to assess whether all data required by this article has been submitted.  The area designated shall become a reserved area as soon as the plan of work for the non-reserved area is approved and the contract is signed.

    <br>In the first accounting year during which development costs are incurred, unrecovered development costs shall equal the development costs less cash surplus in that year.  In each subsequent accounting year, unrecovered development costs shall equal the unrecovered development costs at the end of the preceding accounting year, plus interest thereon at the rate of 10 per cent per annum, plus development costs incurred in the current accounting year and less contractor's cash surplus in the current accounting year.  The accounting year in which unrecovered development costs become zero for the first time shall be the accounting year in which the contractor's development costs with interest on the unrecovered portion thereof are fully recovered by his cash surplus.

When these deductions exceed the contractor's development costs the excess shall be added to the contractor's gross proceeds.
    <br>
    <br>(j) The contractor's development costs incurred prior to the commencement of commercial production referred to in subparagraphs (h)(i) and (n)(iv) shall be recovered in 10 equal annual instalments from the date of commencement of commercial production.

    <br>(vi) "return on investment" in any accounting year means the ratio of the contractor's net proceeds in that year to the contractor's development costs.  For the purpose of computing this ratio, the contractor's development costs shall include expenditures on new or replacement equipment less the original cost of the equipment replaced.
    <br>
    <br>(o) The costs referred to in subparagraphs (h), (k), (l) and (n) in respect of interest paid by the contractor shall be allowed to the extent that, in all the circumstances, the Authority approves, pursuant to article 4, paragraph 1, of this Annex, the debt-equity ratio and the rates of interest as reasonable, having regard to existing commercial practice.

    <br>(i) size of area;

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017AnxIIIA17P1"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl017AnxIIIA17P2">AnxIII.17.2. Rules, regulations and procedures on the following items shall fully reflect the objective criteria set out below:
    <br>
    <br>(a) Size of areas:
    <br>The Authority shall determine the appropriate size of areas for exploration which may be up to twice as large as those for exploitation in order to permit intensive exploration operations.  The size of area shall be calculated to satisfy the requirements of article 8 of this Annex on reservation of areas as well as stated production requirements consistent with article 151 in accordance with the terms of the contract taking into account the state of the art of technology then available for seabed mining and the relevant physical characteristics of the areas.  Areas shall be neither smaller nor larger than are necessary to satisfy this objective.
    <br>
    <br>(b) Duration of operations:
    <br>(i) Prospecting shall be without time-limit;
    <br>(ii) Exploration should be of sufficient duration to permit a thorough survey of the specific area, the design and construction of mining equipment for the area and the design and construction of small and medium-size processing plants for the purpose of testing mining and processing systems;
    <br>(iii) The duration of exploitation should be related to the economic life of the mining project, taking into consideration such factors as the depletion of the ore, the useful life of mining equipment and processing facilities and commercial viability.  Exploitation should be of sufficient duration to permit commercial extraction of minerals of the area and should include a reasonable time period for construction of commercial-scale mining and processing systems, during which period commercial production should not be required.  The total duration of exploitation, however, should also be short enough to give the Authority an opportunity to amend the terms and conditions of the plan of work at the time it considers renewal in accordance with rules, regulations and procedures which it has adopted subsequent to approving the plan of work.
    <br>
    <br>(c) Performance requirements:
    <br>The Authority shall require that during the exploration stage periodic expenditures be made by the operator which are reasonably related to the size of the area covered by the plan of work and the expenditures which would be expected of a <i>bona fide</i> operator who intended to bring the area into commercial production within the time-limits established by the Authority.  The required expenditures should not be established at a level which would discourage prospective operators with less costly technology than is prevalently in use.  The Authority shall establish a maximum time interval, after the exploration stage is completed and the exploitation stage begins, to achieve commercial production.  To determine this interval, the Authority should take into consideration that construction of large-scale mining and processing systems cannot be initiated until after the termination of the exploration stage and the commencement of the exploitation stage.  Accordingly, the interval to bring an area into commercial production should take into account the time necessary for this construction after the completion of the exploration stage and reasonable allowance should be made for unavoidable delays in the construction schedule.  Once commercial production is achieved, the Authority shall within reasonable limits and taking into consideration all relevant factors require the operator to maintain commercial production throughout the period of the plan of work.
    <br>
    <br>(d) Categories of resources:
    <br>In determining the category of resources in respect of which a plan of work may be approved, the Authority shall give emphasis <i>inter alia</i> to the following characteristics:
    <br>(i) that certain resources require the use of similar mining methods; and
    <br>(ii) that some resources can be developed simultaneously without undue interference between operators developing different resources in the same area.
    <br>Nothing in this subparagraph shall preclude the Authority from approving a plan of work with respect to more than one category of resources in the same area to the same applicant.
    <br>
    <br>(e) Renunciation of areas:
    <br>The operator shall have the right at any time to renounce without penalty the whole or part of his rights in the area covered by a plan of work.
    <br>
    <br>(f) Protection of the marine environment:
    <br>Rules, regulations and procedures shall be drawn up in order to secure effective protection of the marine environment from harmful effects directly resulting from activities in the Area or from shipboard processing immediately above a mine site of minerals derived from that mine site, taking into account the extent to which such harmful effects may directly result from drilling, dredging, coring and excavation and from disposal, dumping and discharge into the marine environment of sediment, wastes or other effluents.
    <br>
    <br>(g) Commercial production:
    <br>Commercial production shall be deemed to have begun if an operator engages in sustained large-scale recovery operations which yield a quantity of materials sufficient to indicate clearly that the principal purpose is large-scale production rather than production intended for information gathering, analysis or the testing of equipment or plant.

    <br>(a) Subject to subparagraph (g), the arbitral tribunal shall consist of five members.
    <br>
    <br>(b) The party instituting the proceedings shall appoint one member to be chosen preferably from the list referred to in article 2 of this Annex, who may be its national.  The appointment shall be included in the notification referred to in article l of this Annex.
    <br>
    <br>(c) The other party to the dispute shall, within 30 days of receipt of the notification referred to in article l of this Annex, appoint one member to be chosen preferably from the list, who may be its national.  If the appointment is not made within that period, the party instituting the proceedings may, within two weeks of the expiration of that period, request that the appointment be made in accordance with subparagraph (e).
    <br>
    <br>(d) The other three members shall be appointed by agreement between the parties.  They shall be chosen preferably from the list and shall be nationals of third States unless the parties otherwise agree.  The parties to the dispute shall appoint the President of the arbitral tribunal from among those three members.  If, within 60 days of receipt of the notification referred to in article l of this Annex, the parties are unable to reach agreement on the appointment of one or more of the members of the tribunal to be appointed by agreement, or on the appointment of the President, the remaining appointment or appointments shall be made in accordance with subparagraph (e), at the request of a party to the dispute.  Such request shall be made within two weeks of the expiration of the aforementioned 60-day period.
    <br>
    <br>(e) Unless the parties agree that any appointment under subparagraphs (c) and (d) be made by a person or a third State chosen by the parties, the President of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea shall make the necessary appointments.  If the President is unable to act under this subparagraph or is a national of one of the parties to the dispute, the appointment shall be made by the next senior member of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea who is available and is not a national of one of the parties.  The appointments referred to in this subparagraph shall be made from the list referred to in article 2 of this Annex within a period of 30 days of the receipt of the request and in consultation with the parties.  The members so appointed shall be of different nationalities and may not be in the service of, ordinarily resident in the territory of, or nationals of, any of the parties to the dispute.
    <br>
    <br>(f) Any vacancy shall be filled in the manner prescribed for the initial appointment.
    <br>
    <br>(g) Parties in the same interest shall appoint one member of the tribunal jointly by agreement.  Where there are several parties having separate interests or where there is disagreement as to whether they are of the same interest, each of them shall appoint one member of the tribunal.  The number of members of the tribunal appointed separately by the parties shall always be smaller by one than the number of members of the tribunal to be appointed jointly by the parties.

If the plan of work otherwise satisfies the requirements of the Convention and any rules, regulations and procedures adopted pursuant thereto, it shall be approved by the Council in the form of a contract.  The provisions of section 3, paragraph 11, of this Annex shall be interpreted and applied accordingly;
    <br>(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of resolution II, paragraph 8(a), a registered pioneer investor may request approval of a plan of work for exploration within 36 months of the entry into force of the Convention.

Such changes may apply to existing contracts only at the election of the contractor.  Any subsequent change in choice between alternative systems shall be made by agreement between the Authority and the contractor;
    <br>

  <p id="idLawInl006dsn">description::
    <br>">Rome statute:
    <br>The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC Statute or the Statute) is the international treaty that established the International Criminal Court (ICC). It was adopted at a diplomatic conference in Rome, Italy on 17 July 1998 and it entered into force on 1 July 2002. As of November 2023, 124 states are party to the statute.
    <br>
    <br>**The Statute defines the ICC's jurisdiction, powers, and procedures.** It also establishes the crimes that the ICC can prosecute, which are the most serious crimes of international concern, namely:
    <br>* **Genocide:** The intentional killing of members of a national, ethnical, racial or religious group with the intent to destroy the group.
    <br>* **Crimes against humanity:** A wide range of inhumane acts committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population, such as murder, torture, rape, and enslavement.
    <br>* **War crimes:** Serious violations of international humanitarian law committed during armed conflict, such as the intentional killing of civilians, torture, and the use of prohibited weapons.
    <br>* **The crime of aggression:** The planning, preparation, initiation, or waging of war that is clearly illegal under international law.
    <br>
    <br>The Statute also gives the ICC the power to issue arrest warrants, indictments, and summonses. It also establishes the ICC's trial and appeals chambers, as well as the Office of the Prosecutor and the Registry.
    <br>
    <br>The Rome Statute is a landmark achievement in the fight against impunity for the most serious crimes of international concern. It has helped to establish a permanent and independent international court that can investigate and prosecute individuals for these crimes, regardless of their nationality or the place where the crimes were committed.
    <br>
    <br>Here are some of the key provisions of the Rome Statute:
    <br>* **The ICC is a court of last resort.** This means that it can only intervene if national courts are unwilling or unable to genuinely prosecute the most serious crimes of international concern.
    <br>* **The ICC is a complementary court.** This means that it does not replace national courts, but rather works alongside them.
    <br>* **The ICC is an independent court.** This means that it is not subject to the control of any state or group of states.
    <br>* **The ICC is a fair and impartial court.** This means that it guarantees the rights of both defendants and victims.
    <br>
    <br>The Rome Statute is a complex and comprehensive document. For more information, please see the following resources:

    <br>

  <p id="idLawInl006A19P2">19.2. Challenges to the admissibility of a case on the grounds referred to in article 17 or challenges to the jurisdiction of the Court may be made by:

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A19P2"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl006A19P3">19.3. The Prosecutor may seek a ruling from the Court regarding a question of jurisdiction or admissibility. In proceedings with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility, those who have referred the situation under article 13, as well as victims, may also submit observations to the Court.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A19P3"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl006A19P4">19.4. The admissibility of a case or the jurisdiction of the Court may be challenged only once by any person or State referred to in paragraph 2. The challenge shall take place prior to or at the commencement of the trial. In exceptional circumstances, the Court may grant leave for a challenge to be brought more than once or at a time later than the commencement of the trial. Challenges to the admissibility of a case, at the commencement of a trial, or subsequently with the leave of the Court, may be based only on article 17, paragraph 1 (c).
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A19P4"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl006A19P5">19.5. A State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) and (c) shall make a challenge at the earliest opportunity.

  <p id="idLawInl006A19P6">19.6. Prior to the confirmation of the charges, challenges to the admissibility of a case or challenges to the jurisdiction of the Court shall be referred to the Pre-Trial Chamber. After confirmation of the charges, they shall be referred to the Trial Chamber. Decisions with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility may be appealed to the Appeals Chamber in accordance with article 82.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A19P6"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl006A19P7">19.7. If a challenge is made by a State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) or (c), the Prosecutor shall suspend the investigation until such time as the Court makes a determination in accordance with article 17.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A19P7"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl006A19P8">19.8. Pending a ruling by the Court, the Prosecutor may seek authority from the Court:
    <br>
    <br>(a) To pursue necessary investigative steps of the kind referred to in article 18, paragraph 6;
    <br>
    <br>(b) To take a statement or testimony from a witness or complete the collection and examination of evidence which had begun prior to the making of the challenge; and
    <br>
    <br>(c) In cooperation with the relevant States, to prevent the absconding of persons in respect of whom the Prosecutor has already requested a warrant of arrest under article 58.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A19P8"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl006A19P9">19.9. The making of a challenge shall not affect the validity of any act performed by the Prosecutor or any order or warrant issued by the Court prior to the making of the challenge.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A19P9"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl006A19P10">19.10. If the Court has decided that a case is inadmissible under article 17, the Prosecutor may submit a request for a review of the decision when he or she is fully satisfied that new facts have arisen which negate the basis on which the case had previously been found inadmissible under article 17.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A19P10"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl006A19P11">19.11. If the Prosecutor, having regard to the matters referred to in article 17, defers an investigation, the Prosecutor may request that the relevant State make available to the Prosecutor information on the proceedings. That information shall, at the request of the State concerned, be confidential. If the Prosecutor thereafter decides to proceed with an investigation, he or she shall notify the State to which deferral of the proceedings has taken place.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A31H3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idLawInl006A31P1">31.1. In addition to other grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for in this Statute, a person shall not be criminally responsible if, at the time of that person's conduct:
    <br>
    <br>(a) The person suffers from a mental disease or defect that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate the unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform to the requirements of law;
    <br>
    <br>(b) The person is in a state of intoxication that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate the unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform to the requirements of law, unless the person has become voluntarily intoxicated under such circumstances that the person knew, or disregarded the risk, that, as a result of the intoxication, he or she was likely to engage in conduct constituting a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court;
    <br>
    <br>(c) The person acts reasonably to defend himself or herself or another person or, in the case of war crimes, property which is essential for the survival of the person or another person or property which is essential for accomplishing a military mission, against an imminent and unlawful use of force in a manner proportionate to the degree of danger to the person or the other person or property protected. The fact that the person was involved in a defensive operation conducted by forces shall not in itself constitute a ground for excluding criminal responsibility under this subparagraph;
    <br>
    <br>(d) The conduct which is alleged to constitute a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been caused by duress resulting from a threat of imminent death or of continuing or imminent serious bodily harm against that person or another person, and the person acts necessarily and reasonably to avoid this threat, provided that the person does not intend to cause a greater harm than the one sought to be avoided. Such a threat may either be:
    <br>(i) Made by other persons; or
    <br>(ii) Constituted by other circumstances beyond that person's control.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A31P1"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl006A31P2">31.2. The Court shall determine the applicability of the grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for in this Statute to the case before it.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A31P2"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl006A31P3">31.3. At trial, the Court may consider a ground for excluding criminal responsibility other than those referred to in paragraph 1 where such a ground is derived from applicable law as set forth in article 21. The procedures relating to the consideration of such a ground shall be provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.

Such steps may include:
    <br>
    <br>(a) Modification or clarification of the request;
    <br>
    <br>(b) A determination by the Court regarding the relevance of the information or evidence sought, or a determination as to whether the evidence, though relevant, could be or has been obtained from a source other than the requested State;
    <br>

    <br>(a) Where disclosure of the information or document is sought pursuant to a request for cooperation under Part 9 or the circumstances described in paragraph 2, and the State has invoked the ground for refusal referred to in article 93, paragraph 4:
    <br>(i) The Court may, before making any conclusion referred to in subparagraph 7 (a) (ii), request further consultations for the purpose of considering the State's representations, which may include, as appropriate, hearings <span class="clsU">in camera</span> and <span class="clsU">ex parte</span>;
    <br>(ii) If the Court concludes that, by invoking the ground for refusal under article 93, paragraph 4, in the circumstances of the case, the requested State is not acting in accordance with its obligations under this Statute, the Court may refer the matter in accordance with article 87, paragraph 7, specifying the reasons for its conclusion; and
    <br>(iii) The Court may make such inference in the trial of the accused as to the existence or non-existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances; or
    <br>
    <br>(b) In all other circumstances:
    <br>(i) rder disclosure; or

    <br>
    <br>(a) Reverse or amend the decision or sentence; or

    <br>
    <br>For these purposes, the Appeals Chamber may remand a factual issue to the original Trial Chamber for it to determine the issue and to report back accordingly, or may itself call evidence to determine the issue.

    <br>(a) New evidence has been discovered that:
    <br>(i) Was not available at the time of trial, and such unavailability was not wholly or partially attributable to the party making application; and
    <br>(ii) Is sufficiently important that had it been proved at trial it would have been likely to have resulted in a different verdict;
    <br>
    <br>(b) It has been newly discovered that decisive evidence, taken into account at trial and upon which the conviction depends, was false, forged or falsified;
    <br>
    <br>(c) One or more of the judges who participated in conviction or confirmation of the charges has committed, in that case, an act of serious misconduct or serious breach of duty of sufficient gravity to justify the removal of that judge or those judges from office under article 46.

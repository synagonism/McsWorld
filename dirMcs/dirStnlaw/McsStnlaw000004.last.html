    <br>">international law:
    <br>International law is a set of rules and principles that govern the relationships between sovereign states and other international actors, such as international organizations and individuals. It is a complex and dynamic field that encompasses various legal frameworks, treaties, conventions, customary practices, and principles.
    <br>
    <br>Key elements of international law include:
    <br>1. **Sources of International Law:**
    <br>   - **Treaties:** Agreements between states that are binding under international law.
    <br>   - **Customary International Law:** Practices that have developed among states and are accepted as legally binding.
    <br>   - **General Principles of Law:** Legal principles common to various legal systems.
    <br>   - **Judicial Decisions and Scholarly Writings:** These are considered subsidiary sources of international law.
    <br>
    <br>2. **Subjects of International Law:**
    <br>   - **States:** The primary subjects of international law.
    <br>   - **International Organizations:** Entities like the United Nations, International Court of Justice, etc.
    <br>   - **Individuals:** Increasingly, individuals are recognized as having certain rights and responsibilities under international law.
    <br>
    <br>3. **State Sovereignty:**
    <br>   - The principle of state sovereignty is a fundamental aspect of international law, emphasizing the equality of states and their right to govern their internal affairs without external interference.
    <br>
    <br>4. **International Human Rights Law:**
    <br>   - Protects the rights and dignity of individuals globally. Key documents include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and various conventions.
    <br>
    <br>5. **International Humanitarian Law:**
    <br>   - Governs the conduct of armed conflict, aiming to protect civilians and combatants who are no longer taking part in hostilities.
    <br>
    <br>6. **International Environmental Law:**
    <br>   - Addresses global environmental challenges and promotes sustainable development.
    <br>
    <br>7. **International Criminal Law:**
    <br>   - Deals with crimes of an international concern, such as genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.
    <br>
    <br>8. **Use of Force and Peaceful Settlement of Disputes:**
    <br>   - The United Nations Charter regulates the use of force among states and promotes peaceful settlement of disputes.
    <br>
    <br>9. **International Courts and Tribunals:**
    <br>   - Entities like the International Court of Justice (ICJ) adjudicate disputes between states, while other tribunals focus on specific issues like trade or human rights.
    <br>
    <br>10. **Diplomatic and Consular Law:**
    <br>    - Regulates the conduct of states and their representatives in their diplomatic and consular relations.
    <br>
    <br>It's important to note that enforcement mechanisms in international law are often weaker compared to domestic legal systems. Compliance relies heavily on the willingness of states to adhere to their international obligations. The field continues to evolve as new challenges arise in the global community."

    <br>">subjects of international-law:
    <br>The subjects of international law are the entities that have the capacity to bear rights and obligations under international law. These entities include:
    <br>* **States:** States are the primary subjects of international law. They are defined as independent political entities that have control over a defined territory and population. States have the capacity to enter into treaties, to make war and peace, and to send and receive diplomatic representatives.
    <br>* **International organizations:** International organizations are entities that are created by states to cooperate on matters of common interest. These organizations can be either governmental or non-governmental. They have the capacity to enter into treaties, to make decisions that are binding on their member states, and to enjoy certain privileges and immunities.
    <br>* **Non-state entities:** Non-state entities are entities that are not states or international organizations. These entities can include individuals, corporations, and other legal entities. Non-state entities can have the capacity to bear rights and obligations under international law, but their capacity is generally more limited than that of states or international organizations. For example, individuals can be brought to trial for international crimes, but they cannot enter into treaties.
    <br>* **Special case entities:** Special case entities are entities that do not fit neatly into the categories of states, international organizations, or non-state entities. These entities can include the Holy See, the Order of Malta, and certain other entities that have been recognized as subjects of international law by the international community.
    <br>
    <br>The status of subjects of international law is important because it determines which entities can be held responsible for violations of international law. It also determines which entities can enjoy the rights and privileges that are protected by international law.
    <br>
    <br>The traditional view of the subjects of international law was that only states could be subjects of international law. However, in recent years, there has been a growing recognition that other entities, such as international organizations, non-state entities, and individuals, can also be subjects of international law. This recognition is reflected in the development of new bodies of international law, such as international human rights law and international criminal law.
    <br>
    <br>The development of the concept of the subjects of international law is an ongoing process. As the international community becomes more complex, new entities will emerge that may need to be recognized as subjects of international law."

    <br>">International-court-of-justice:
    <br>The International Court of Justice (ICJ), also known as the World Court, is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations (UN). It settles disputes between states in accordance with international law and gives advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by authorized United Nations organs and specialized agencies.
    <br>
    <br>**Jurisdiction**
    <br>The ICJ has jurisdiction to hear cases between states that have accepted its jurisdiction. States may accept the ICJ's jurisdiction by making a declaration under Article 36 of the ICJ Statute or by agreeing to its jurisdiction in a specific case. The ICJ may also hear cases between states that are parties to a treaty that provides for the settlement of disputes by the ICJ.
    <br>
    <br>**Procedure**
    <br>Cases before the ICJ are initiated by the filing of a written application with the Registry of the Court. The application must be filed by a state that is a party to the dispute. Once the application has been filed, the Registry of the Court sends a copy of it to the other state or states that are parties to the dispute. The other state or states then have a period of time to file a written reply to the application.
    <br>Once the pleadings have been exchanged, the ICJ may hold a hearing on the case. The hearing is an opportunity for the parties to present their arguments to the Court in person. The Court may also ask questions of the parties and their representatives.
    <br>After the hearing, the ICJ closes the case for deliberation. The Court then deliberates in private and reaches a decision by a majority vote. The decision of the Court is final and binding on the parties to the dispute.
    <br>
    <br>**Advisory opinions**
    <br>The ICJ may also give advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by authorized United Nations organs and specialized agencies. These opinions are not binding, but they are influential sources of international law.
    <br>
    <br>**The role of the ICJ**
    <br>The ICJ plays an important role in the international legal system. It is a court of last resort for states that are unable to resolve their disputes through other means. The ICJ's decisions help to develop and clarify international law. The Court's advisory opinions also provide guidance to the United Nations and its specialized agencies.
    <br>The ICJ is a permanent and independent court. Its judges are elected by the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council. The judges are independent of their governments and serve on the Court for a term of nine years.
    <br>The ICJ is located in The Hague, Netherlands. The Court's official languages are English and French.
    <br>
    <br>**Conclusion**
    <br>The ICJ is an important institution in the international legal system. It plays a vital role in the settlement of international disputes and the development of international law. The Court's work helps to promote peace and justice in the world.

    <br>">jurisdiction of International-Court-of-Justice
    <br>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. It is the only international court with jurisdiction over states to resolve legal disputes between them. The ICJ's jurisdiction is both contentious and advisory.
    <br>
    <br>**Contentious Jurisdiction**
    <br>The ICJ's contentious jurisdiction is exercised in accordance with international law and allows states to bring legal disputes against each other. There are two main ways for a state to refer a dispute to the ICJ:
    <br>1. **Voluntary submission:** A state can agree to submit a particular dispute to the ICJ by signing a special agreement, known as a compromis, with the other state involved in the dispute.
    <br>2. **Declarations under Article 36(2) of the Statute:** States may also make a declaration recognizing the compulsory jurisdiction of the ICJ for certain categories of disputes. This means that they agree to submit to the ICJ's jurisdiction without having to sign a special agreement each time a dispute arises.
    <br>The ICJ's contentious jurisdiction is limited to disputes between states. It cannot hear cases between individuals or non-state entities. Additionally, the ICJ's jurisdiction is based on consent, meaning that both parties to a dispute must agree to submit it to the Court for adjudication.
    <br>
    <br>**Advisory Jurisdiction**
    <br>The ICJ's advisory jurisdiction is exercised at the request of authorized United Nations organs or specialized agencies. The Court is asked to provide an opinion on legal questions that are relevant to the work of the requesting body. Advisory opinions are not binding, but they can be influential in shaping international law.
    <br>In order for the ICJ to exercise its advisory jurisdiction, the following conditions must be met:
    <br>1. **The requesting body must be authorized to make the request:** Only the Security Council, the General Assembly, and certain specialized agencies are authorized to request an advisory opinion from the ICJ.
    <br>2. **The question put to the ICJ must be of a legal nature:** The question must be capable of being resolved by the application of legal principles and rules.
    <br>3. **The question must not be of a political nature:** The question must not be primarily concerned with matters of policy or expediency.
    <br>4. **The question must not be one that the Court is not already seized of, or that the Court has already decided in a previous advisory opinion:** The Court will not provide an advisory opinion on a question that it has already ruled on, or that is pending before the Court in contentious proceedings.
    <br>The ICJ's advisory jurisdiction has been used to address a wide range of legal questions, including the interpretation of treaties, the legality of international acts, and the status of individuals in international law. Advisory opinions can be a valuable tool for clarifying international law and promoting its development.
    <br>
    <br>In summary, the International Court of Justice has two main types of jurisdiction: contentious and advisory. Contentious jurisdiction allows states to bring legal disputes against each other, while advisory jurisdiction allows the Court to provide opinions on legal questions at the request of authorized United Nations organs or specialized agencies."

    <br>">International-Criminal-Court:
    <br>The International Criminal Court (ICC) is the first and only permanent, treaty-based international criminal court that investigates and prosecutes individuals accused of the most serious crimes of international concern, namely genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression. The ICC is a court of last resort, meaning it can only intervene if national courts are unwilling or unable to genuinely prosecute these crimes.
    <br>
    <br>**Here are some of the key facts about the ICC:**
    <br>* **Established:** 2002
    <br>* **Headquarters:** The Hague, Netherlands
    <br>* **Number of member states:** 123
    <br>* **Jurisdiction:** The ICC can investigate and prosecute crimes committed on the territory of a member state, or by a national of a member state.
    <br>
    <br>**The ICC has investigated and prosecuted crimes in a number of countries, including:**
    <br>* **Africa:** Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan, Uganda, Central African Republic, Côte d'Ivoire, Kenya, Mali, Libya, Burundi, and South Sudan
    <br>* **Asia:** Afghanistan, Iraq, Georgia, and the Philippines
    <br>* **Europe:** Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo, Georgia, and Ukraine
    <br>* **Americas:** Colombia, Guatemala, and Honduras
    <br>
    <br>**The ICC has faced a number of challenges, including:**
    <br>* **Limited cooperation from some states:** Some states, such as the United States, are not members of the ICC and have not cooperated with its investigations.
    <br>* **Resource constraints:** The ICC is a relatively new institution and has limited resources. This has made it difficult to investigate and prosecute all of the cases that it has been referred.
    <br>* **Lack of enforcement power:** The ICC does not have its own police force or prisons. It relies on member states to cooperate with its arrest warrants and to enforce its sentences.
    <br>
    <br>Despite these challenges, the ICC has made a significant contribution to the fight against impunity for the most serious crimes of international concern. It has brought justice to victims, deterred future crimes, and helped to strengthen the rule of law.

    <br>"The International Criminal Court (ICC or ICCt)[2] is an intergovernmental organization and international tribunal that sits in The Hague, Netherlands. The ICC is the first and only permanent international court with jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for the international crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression. It is intended to complement existing national judicial systems and it may therefore exercise its jurisdiction only when national courts are unwilling or unable to prosecute criminals. The ICC lacks universal territorial jurisdiction, and may only investigate and prosecute crimes committed within member states, crimes committed by nationals of member states, or crimes in situations referred to the Court by the United Nations Security Council.
    <br>The ICC began operations on 1 July 2002, upon the entry into force of the Rome Statute, a multilateral treaty that serves as the court's foundational and governing document. States which become party to the Rome Statute become members of the ICC, serving on the Assembly of States Parties, which administers the court. As of December 2020, there are 123 ICC member states; 42 states have neither signed nor become parties to the Rome Statute."

    <br>">evolution of international-criminal-court:
    <br>The evolution of the International Criminal Court (ICC) can be traced back to the atrocities committed during World War II, which sparked the establishment of the Nuremberg and Tokyo Tribunals. These tribunals, while groundbreaking in their own right, were ad hoc courts limited to specific conflicts and perpetrators. The desire for a permanent international criminal court emerged to address the most serious crimes of international concern, regardless of where or when they were committed.
    <br>
    <br>In 1948, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, marking a significant step towards establishing an international criminal justice system. However, the idea of a permanent ICC remained elusive for decades due to political and legal challenges.
    <br>
    <br>A breakthrough came in 1998 when 120 states adopted the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the legal basis for establishing the ICC. The Rome Statute defined the ICC's jurisdiction, powers, and procedures, and established the crimes that the ICC could prosecute.
    <br>
    <br>The ICC officially came into force on July 1, 2002, with 60 states becoming parties to the Rome Statute. Since then, the ICC has evolved into a crucial institution in the pursuit of international criminal justice.
    <br>
    <br>Key milestones in the evolution of the ICC include:
    <br>1. **Establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Establishment of an International Criminal Court (1995):** This committee was tasked with preparing a draft statute for an ICC, which eventually formed the basis for the Rome Statute.
    <br>
    <br>2. **Adoption of the Rome Statute (1998):** The adoption of the Rome Statute marked a major turning point, establishing the legal framework for the ICC.
    <br>
    <br>3. **Entry into force of the Rome Statute (2002):** With the ratification of the Rome Statute by 60 states, the ICC officially came into existence.
    <br>
    <br>4. **Opening of the ICC's headquarters in The Hague (2003):** The ICC established its permanent headquarters in The Hague, Netherlands.
    <br>
    <br>5. **Issuance of the first arrest warrant (2006):** The ICC issued its first arrest warrant for Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, a Congolese warlord accused of recruiting and using child soldiers.
    <br>
    <br>6. **First convictions (2012):** The ICC handed down its first convictions against Thomas Lubanga Dyilo and Germain Katanga, both Congolese warlords.
    <br>
    <br>7. **Opening of investigations in new regions (2015-present):** The ICC expanded its investigations to include situations in Latin America, Asia, and the Middle East.
    <br>
    <br>8. **Adoption of the crime of aggression (2017):** The ICC amended its Rome Statute to include the crime of aggression, a significant step in addressing the most serious crime under international law.
    <br>
    <br>The ICC continues to evolve, facing challenges and opportunities as it strives to fulfill its mandate of upholding international criminal justice. The court's ability to investigate and prosecute the most serious crimes of international concern, regardless of where or when they were committed, has set a precedent for international criminal justice.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInlenfmH2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idLawInlenfmdsn">description::
    <br>">enforcement of international-law:
    <br>The enforcement of international law is a complex and multifaceted issue. Unlike domestic law, which is enforced by a centralized authority with a monopoly on violence, international law is enforced through a decentralized system of self-help, cooperation, and institutions. This means that there is no single body or mechanism that is responsible for enforcing international law, and the effectiveness of enforcement varies depending on the specific norm, the parties involved, and the circumstances of the case.
    <br>**Self-help** is the most common method of enforcing international law. This means that states take action themselves to ensure that other states comply with international law. Self-help measures can be diplomatic, such as protest or suspension of relations, or they can be economic, such as sanctions or boycotts. In some cases, states may even resort to the use of force to enforce international law.
    <br>**Cooperation** is also an important factor in the enforcement of international law. States often work together to enforce international law through treaties, international organizations, and other multilateral mechanisms. For example, the United Nations Security Council can authorize the use of force to enforce international law, and the International Criminal Court can prosecute individuals for serious violations of international law.
    <br>**Institutions** play a crucial role in the enforcement of international law. These institutions can provide a forum for states to resolve disputes, monitor compliance with international law, and impose sanctions on states that violate international law. Some of the most important international institutions for the enforcement of international law include the International Court of Justice, the World Trade Organization, and the International Monetary Fund.
    <br>
    <br>The enforcement of international law is often challenging, but it is essential for maintaining a rules-based order in the international system. Without effective enforcement, international law would be nothing more than a set of empty promises.
    <br>
    <br>Here are some of the specific methods that are used to enforce international law:
    <br>* **Diplomatic measures:** These measures include protest, suspension of relations, and diplomatic isolation.
    <br>* **Economic measures:** These measures include sanctions, boycotts, and asset freezes.
    <br>* **Judicial measures:** These measures involve bringing cases against states or individuals who have violated international law.
    <br>* **Use of force:** This is a measure of last resort and is only authorized under international law in very limited circumstances.
    <br>
    <br>The effectiveness of international law enforcement varies depending on the specific norm, the parties involved, and the circumstances of the case. Some norms are more easily enforced than others, and states are more likely to comply with international law when they are powerful and have a strong interest in the norm being enforced.
    <br>
    <br>In recent years, there have been a number of initiatives to strengthen the enforcement of international law. These initiatives include the creation of new international courts and tribunals, the development of new enforcement mechanisms, and the increased use of sanctions and other punitive measures.
    <br>
    <br>Despite these efforts, the enforcement of international law remains a challenge. This is due to a number of factors, including the decentralized nature of the international system, the reluctance of states to use force, and the lack of a centralized enforcement authority. However, there is a growing recognition of the importance of international law, and there is a renewed commitment to strengthening its enforcement."

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInlevgFH1"></a></h1>
  <p id="idLawInlevgFdsn">description::
    <br>">evolution of international-law:
    <br>Sure, here is a summary of the evolution of international law:
    <br>
    <br>**Early Origins**
    <br>The roots of international law can be traced back to ancient civilizations, where treaties and customary practices governed interactions between states. However, it was in Europe that international law truly began to develop, driven by the need to manage relations between increasingly interconnected states.
    <br>
    <br>**Emergence of Modern International Law**
    <br>The Peace of Westphalia, concluded in 1648, marked a turning point in the development of international law. The treaty established the principle of state sovereignty, which laid the foundation for the modern international legal system.
    <br>
    <br>**Hugo Grotius and the Rise of Natural Law**
    <br>Hugo Grotius, a Dutch jurist, is widely considered the father of international law. His seminal work, "De Jure Belli ac Pacis" (On the Law of War and Peace), published in 1625, laid out the foundations of natural law, which posited that international law was derived from universal moral principles.
    <br>
    <br>**Positivism and the Rise of State Consent**
    <br>In the 19th century, positivism emerged as the dominant theory of international law. Positivists argued that international law was not based on natural law but rather on the consent of states. This shift reflected the growing importance of state sovereignty and the development of treaties as the primary source of international law.
    <br>
    <br>**The Hague Conventions and the Codification of International Law**
    <br>The Hague Conventions, held in 1899 and 1907, were a landmark in the codification of international law. The conventions addressed a range of issues, including the conduct of warfare and the protection of neutral states.
    <br>
    <br>**The League of Nations and the Rise of International Institutions**
    <br>The establishment of the League of Nations in 1920 marked a new era in international law. The League was the first permanent international organization dedicated to maintaining peace and security. It also played a role in codifying international law through conventions and treaties.
    <br>
    <br>**The United Nations and the Post-World War II Era**
    <br>The United Nations, established in 1945, replaced the League of Nations and became the central forum for international cooperation and lawmaking. The UN Charter enshrines key principles of international law, such as the prohibition of the use of force and the peaceful settlement of disputes.
    <br>
    <br>**Contemporary Developments in International Law**
    <br>International law has continued to evolve in the post-Cold War era, addressing new challenges such as globalization, environmental protection, and human rights. International institutions, such as the World Trade Organization and the International Criminal Court, have also emerged to play an increasingly important role in upholding international law.
    <br>
    <br>**Key Themes in the Evolution of International Law**
    <br>The evolution of international law has been shaped by several key themes:
    <br>* **Sovereignty:** The principle of state sovereignty has been central to the development of international law.
    <br>* **Consent:** The principle of state consent is the basis for the creation of international obligations.
    <br>* **Codification:** The codification of international law into treaties and conventions has provided greater clarity and certainty.
    <br>* **Institutionalization:** International institutions have played an increasingly important role in upholding international law.
    <br>* **Emerging Challenges:** International law is constantly evolving to address new challenges, such as globalization, environmental protection, and human rights.
    <br>
    <br>**Conclusion**
    <br>International law has played a crucial role in promoting cooperation, maintaining peace, and protecting human rights in the global arena. As the world continues to face complex and interconnected challenges, international law will remain an essential tool for managing relations between states and upholding the rule of law."

    <br>">evolution of international-law:
    <br>The evolution of international law is a complex and dynamic process that has taken place over centuries. It has been shaped by historical events, changes in state practices, and the development of new norms and institutions. Here is a brief overview of key stages in the evolution of international law:
    <br>
    <br>1. **Ancient and Medieval Periods (3000 BCE – 1648 CE):**
    <br>   - During ancient times, various civilizations had systems of customary laws governing relations between states and individuals.
    <br>   - In medieval Europe, the Catholic Church played a significant role in shaping laws and norms, particularly through the concept of "just war" and the idea of a natural law governing human conduct.
    <br>
    <br>2. **Peace of Westphalia (1648):**
    <br>   - The Peace of Westphalia is often considered a foundational moment for modern international law. It ended the Thirty Years' War and marked the beginning of the state-centric system.
    <br>   - The principle of state sovereignty emerged, emphasizing non-intervention in the domestic affairs of sovereign states.
    <br>
    <br>3. **18th and 19th Centuries:**
    <br>   - Emergence of the law of nations and the development of the idea of international legal personality for states.
    <br>   - The publication of legal scholars such as Emer de Vattel contributed to the codification and understanding of international law principles.
    <br>
    <br>4. **Hague Conferences (1899 and 1907):**
    <br>   - The conferences aimed to codify laws of war and establish the Permanent Court of Arbitration, reflecting a growing interest in international cooperation and dispute resolution.
    <br>
    <br>5. **League of Nations (1920):**
    <br>   - The League of Nations was the first international organization with the goal of maintaining peace and preventing conflicts.
    <br>   - It contributed to the development of international law through treaties and agreements.
    <br>
    <br>6. **Post-World War II Era:**
    <br>   - The United Nations (UN) was established in 1945, with its Charter serving as a foundational document of modern international law.
    <br>   - The Nuremberg Trials set important precedents for prosecuting individuals for war crimes and crimes against humanity.
    <br>
    <br>7. **Cold War and Decolonization:**
    <br>   - The Cold War era saw a focus on arms control and the development of treaties addressing issues such as nuclear weapons and the law of the sea.
    <br>   - Decolonization led to the creation of new states, influencing the development of international legal norms.
    <br>
    <br>8. **Contemporary Period:**
    <br>   - The end of the Cold War marked a shift in international relations, with increased emphasis on human rights, humanitarian intervention, and the responsibility to protect (R2P).
    <br>   - International criminal tribunals, such as the International Criminal Court (ICC), were established to prosecute individuals for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.
    <br>
    <br>9. **Globalization and New Challenges:**
    <br>   - Globalization has brought about new challenges, including issues related to the environment, cybersecurity, and transnational crime.
    <br>   - Efforts to address these challenges involve the development of new legal frameworks and mechanisms.
    <br>
    <br>The evolution of international law continues as the international community grapples with contemporary issues and strives to adapt legal norms to the changing global landscape. Ongoing developments include efforts to strengthen international institutions, enhance accountability, and address emerging threats to peace and security."

    <br>">types of international-law:
    <br>International law can be broadly divided into two main categories: public international law and private international law.
    <br>
    <br>**Public international law** is concerned with the relationships between states. It governs such matters as diplomacy, war, and trade. Some of the most important sources of public international law are treaties, customary international law, and general principles of law.
    <br>**Private international law** is concerned with the relationships between private individuals and entities in different countries. It governs such matters as contracts, torts, and family law. Some of the most important sources of private international law are treaties, custom, and general principles of law.
    <br>
    <br>Here are some of the specific areas of international law:
    <br>* **International economic law** is concerned with the economic relations between states. It governs such matters as trade, investment, and finance.
    <br>* **International security law** is concerned with the use of force by states. It governs such matters as war, self-defense, and nuclear weapons.
    <br>* **International criminal law** is concerned with the prosecution of individuals for crimes such as genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.
    <br>* **International environmental law** is concerned with the protection of the environment. It governs such matters as pollution, climate change, and biodiversity.
    <br>* **Diplomatic law** is concerned with the conduct of relations between states. It governs such matters as immunity, privileges, and ceremonies.
    <br>* **Human rights law** is concerned with the protection of the human rights of individuals. It governs such matters as freedom of expression, freedom of association, and the right to life.
    <br>* **International humanitarian law** is concerned with the protection of individuals during armed conflict. It governs such matters as the use of force, the treatment of prisoners of war, and the protection of civilians.
    <br>* **International law of the sea** is concerned with the use of the oceans. It governs such matters as fishing, navigation, and pollution.
    <br>* **Space law** is concerned with the use of outer space. It governs such matters as the exploration of space, the use of satellites, and the militarization of space."

    <br>">international law of war:
    <br>International humanitarian law (IHL), also known as the law of armed conflict, is a body of law that regulates the conduct of hostilities and seeks to limit the suffering caused by armed conflict. IHL applies to all parties to an armed conflict, whether they are states or non-state actors.
    <br>
    <br>The main principles of IHL are:
    <br>* **Humanity:** Civilians and combatants who are no longer taking part in hostilities must be treated humanely. This means that they must not be killed, tortured, or subjected to other forms of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.
    <br>* **Distinction:** Civilians and civilian objects must be distinguished from combatants and military objectives. Attacks must be directed only at military objectives, and civilians must not be deliberately targeted.
    <br>* **Proportionality:** The expected military advantage of an attack must outweigh the expected civilian harm. Attacks that are likely to cause excessive civilian harm are prohibited.
    <br>* **Precautions in attack:** Parties to an armed conflict must take all feasible precautions to minimize civilian harm. This includes taking measures to avoid civilian casualties, such as giving advance warning of attacks.
    <br>
    <br>IHL is based on a number of treaties and conventions, including the Geneva Conventions, the Hague Conventions, and the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions. These treaties and conventions have been ratified by most countries in the world.
    <br>
    <br>IHL is enforced by a number of bodies, including the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the United Nations Security Council, and national courts. The ICRC is a humanitarian organization that works to protect the lives and dignity of people affected by armed conflict. The United Nations Security Council has the power to authorize the use of force and to impose sanctions on countries that violate IHL. National courts can prosecute individuals for war crimes, which are serious violations of IHL.
    <br>
    <br>IHL is an important tool for protecting civilians and limiting the suffering caused by armed conflict. It is a complex body of law, but it is essential for ensuring that armed conflicts are conducted in a humane manner."

    <br>"Customary international law is an aspect of international law involving the principle of custom. Along with general principles of law and treaties, custom is considered by the International Court of Justice, jurists, the United Nations, and its member states to be among the primary sources of international law.
    <br>Many governments accept in principle the existence of customary international law, although there are differing opinions as to what rules are contained in it.
    <br>In 1950, the International Law Commission listed the following sources as forms of evidence of customary international law: treaties, decisions of national and international courts, national legislation, opinions of national legal advisors, diplomatic correspondence, and practice of international organizations.[1] In 2018, the Commission adopted Conclusions on Identification of Customary International Law with commentaries.[2] The United Nations General Assembly welcomed the Conclusions and encouraged their widest possible dissemination.[3]"

  <p id="idUnudhrPrmblP3">Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law,

    <br>">Rome statute:
    <br>The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC Statute or the Statute) is the international treaty that established the International Criminal Court (ICC). It was adopted at a diplomatic conference in Rome, Italy on 17 July 1998 and it entered into force on 1 July 2002. As of November 2023, 124 states are party to the statute.
    <br>
    <br>**The Statute defines the ICC's jurisdiction, powers, and procedures.** It also establishes the crimes that the ICC can prosecute, which are the most serious crimes of international concern, namely:
    <br>* **Genocide:** The intentional killing of members of a national, ethnical, racial or religious group with the intent to destroy the group.
    <br>* **Crimes against humanity:** A wide range of inhumane acts committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population, such as murder, torture, rape, and enslavement.
    <br>* **War crimes:** Serious violations of international humanitarian law committed during armed conflict, such as the intentional killing of civilians, torture, and the use of prohibited weapons.
    <br>* **The crime of aggression:** The planning, preparation, initiation, or waging of war that is clearly illegal under international law.
    <br>
    <br>The Statute also gives the ICC the power to issue arrest warrants, indictments, and summonses. It also establishes the ICC's trial and appeals chambers, as well as the Office of the Prosecutor and the Registry.
    <br>
    <br>The Rome Statute is a landmark achievement in the fight against impunity for the most serious crimes of international concern. It has helped to establish a permanent and independent international court that can investigate and prosecute individuals for these crimes, regardless of their nationality or the place where the crimes were committed.
    <br>
    <br>Here are some of the key provisions of the Rome Statute:
    <br>* **The ICC is a court of last resort.** This means that it can only intervene if national courts are unwilling or unable to genuinely prosecute the most serious crimes of international concern.
    <br>* **The ICC is a complementary court.** This means that it does not replace national courts, but rather works alongside them.
    <br>* **The ICC is an independent court.** This means that it is not subject to the control of any state or group of states.
    <br>* **The ICC is a fair and impartial court.** This means that it guarantees the rights of both defendants and victims.
    <br>
    <br>The Rome Statute is a complex and comprehensive document. For more information, please see the following resources:

    <br>
    <br>(f) Paragraph 2 (e) applies to armed conflicts not of an international character and thus does not apply to situations of internal disturbances and tensions, such as riots, isolated and sporadic acts of violence or other acts of a similar nature.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A19H3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idLawInl006A19P1">1. The Court shall satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in any case brought before it. The Court may, on its own motion, determine the admissibility of a case in accordance with article 17.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A19P1"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl006A19P2">2. Challenges to the admissibility of a case on the grounds referred to in article 17 or challenges to the jurisdiction of the Court may be made by:
    <br>
    <br>(a) An accused or a person for whom a warrant of arrest or a summons to appear has been issued under article 58;
    <br>
    <br>(b) A State which has jurisdiction over a case, on the ground that it is investigating or prosecuting the case or has investigated or prosecuted; or
    <br>
    <br>(c) A State from which acceptance of jurisdiction is required under article 12.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A19P2"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl006A19P3">3. The Prosecutor may seek a ruling from the Court regarding a question of jurisdiction or admissibility. In proceedings with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility, those who have referred the situation under article 13, as well as victims, may also submit observations to the Court.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A19P3"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl006A19P4">4. The admissibility of a case or the jurisdiction of the Court may be challenged only once by any person or State referred to in paragraph 2. The challenge shall take place prior to or at the commencement of the trial. In exceptional circumstances, the Court may grant leave for a challenge to be brought more than once or at a time later than the commencement of the trial. Challenges to the admissibility of a case, at the commencement of a trial, or subsequently with the leave of the Court, may be based only on article 17, paragraph 1 (c).
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A19P4"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl006A19P5">5. A State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) and (c) shall make a challenge at the earliest opportunity.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A19P5"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl006A19P6">6. Prior to the confirmation of the charges, challenges to the admissibility of a case or challenges to the jurisdiction of the Court shall be referred to the Pre-Trial Chamber. After confirmation of the charges, they shall be referred to the Trial Chamber. Decisions with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility may be appealed to the Appeals Chamber in accordance with article 82.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A19P6"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl006A19P7">7. If a challenge is made by a State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) or (c), the Prosecutor shall suspend the investigation until such time as the Court makes a determination in accordance with article 17.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A19P7"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl006A19P8">8. Pending a ruling by the Court, the Prosecutor may seek authority from the Court:
    <br>
    <br>(a) To pursue necessary investigative steps of the kind referred to in article 18, paragraph 6;
    <br>
    <br>(b) To take a statement or testimony from a witness or complete the collection and examination of evidence which had begun prior to the making of the challenge; and
    <br>
    <br>(c) In cooperation with the relevant States, to prevent the absconding of persons in respect of whom the Prosecutor has already requested a warrant of arrest under article 58.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A19P8"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl006A19P9">9. The making of a challenge shall not affect the validity of any act performed by the Prosecutor or any order or warrant issued by the Court prior to the making of the challenge.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A19P9"></a></p>
  <p> id="idLawInl006A19P10">10. If the Court has decided that a case is inadmissible under article 17, the Prosecutor may submit a request for a review of the decision when he or she is fully satisfied that new facts have arisen which negate the basis on which the case had previously been found inadmissible under article 17.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A19P10"></a></p>
  <p> id="idLawInl006A19P11">11. If the Prosecutor, having regard to the matters referred to in article 17, defers an investigation, the Prosecutor may request that the relevant State make available to the Prosecutor information on the proceedings. That information shall, at the request of the State concerned, be confidential. If the Prosecutor thereafter decides to proceed with an investigation, he or she shall notify the State to which deferral of the proceedings has taken place.

Such cases include those falling within the scope of article 56, paragraphs 2 and 3, article 61, paragraph 3, article 64, paragraph 3, article 67, paragraph 2, article 68, paragraph 6, article 87, paragraph 6 and article 93, as well as cases arising at any other stage of the proceedings where such disclosure may be at issue.

  <p id="idLawInl006A72P2">2. This article shall also apply when a person who has been requested to give information or evidence has refused to do so or has referred the matter to the State on the ground that disclosure would prejudice the national security interests of a State and the State concerned confirms that it is of the opinion that disclosure would prejudice its national security interests.

If, in the opinion of a State, disclosure of information would prejudice its national security interests, all reasonable steps will be taken by the State, acting in conjunction with the Prosecutor, the defence or the Pre-Trial Chamber or Trial Chamber, as the case may be, to seek to resolve the matter by cooperative means. Such steps may include:
    <br>
    <br>(a) Modification or clarification of the request;
    <br>
    <br>(b) A determination by the Court regarding the relevance of the information or evidence sought, or a determination as to whether the evidence, though relevant, could be or has been obtained from a source other than the requested State;
    <br>
    <br>(c) Obtaining the information or evidence from a different source or in a different form; or
    <br>
    <br>(d) Agreement on conditions under which the assistance could be provided including, among other things, providing summaries or redactions, limitations on disclosure, use of <span class="clsU">in camera</span> or <span class="clsU">ex parte</span> proceedings, or other protective measures permissible under the Statute and the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.

    <br>(a) Where disclosure of the information or document is sought pursuant to a request for cooperation under Part 9 or the circumstances described in paragraph 2, and the State has invoked the ground for refusal referred to in article 93, paragraph 4:
    <br>(i) The Court may, before making any conclusion referred to in subparagraph 7 (a) (ii), request further consultations for the purpose of considering the State's representations, which may include, as appropriate, hearings <span class="clsU">in camera</span> and <span class="clsU">ex parte</span>;
    <br>(ii) If the Court concludes that, by invoking the ground for refusal under article 93, paragraph 4, in the circumstances of the case, the requested State is not acting in accordance with its obligations under this Statute, the Court may refer the matter in accordance with article 87, paragraph 7, specifying the reasons for its conclusion; and
    <br>(iii) The Court may make such inference in the trial of the accused as to the existence or non-existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances; or
    <br>
    <br>(b) In all other circumstances:
    <br>(i) rder disclosure; or
    <br>(ii) To the extent it does not order disclosure, make such inference in the trial of the accused as to the existence or non-existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances.

  <p id="idLawInl006A83P1">1. For the purposes of proceedings under article 81 and this article, the Appeals Chamber shall have all the powers of the Trial Chamber.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A83P1"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl006A83P2">2. If the Appeals Chamber finds that the proceedings appealed from were unfair in a way that affected the reliability of the decision or sentence, or that the decision or sentence appealed from was materially affected by error of fact or law or procedural error, it may:
    <br>
    <br>(a) Reverse or amend the decision or sentence; or
    <br>
    <br>(b) Order a new trial before a different Trial Chamber.
    <br>
    <br>For these purposes, the Appeals Chamber may remand a factual issue to the original Trial Chamber for it to determine the issue and to report back accordingly, or may itself call evidence to determine the issue. When the decision or sentence has been appealed only by the person convicted, or the Prosecutor on that person's behalf, it cannot be amended to his or her detriment.

  <p id="idLawInl006A83P4">4. The judgement of the Appeals Chamber shall be taken by a majority of the judges and shall be delivered in open court. The judgement shall state the reasons on which it is based. When there is no unanimity, the judgement of the Appeals Chamber shall contain the views of the majority and the minority, but a judge may deliver a separate or dissenting opinion on a question of law.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A83P4"></a></p>

    <br>
    <br>(a) New evidence has been discovered that:
    <br>(i) Was not available at the time of trial, and such unavailability was not wholly or partially attributable to the party making application; and
    <br>(ii) Is sufficiently important that had it been proved at trial it would have been likely to have resulted in a different verdict;
    <br>
    <br>(b) It has been newly discovered that decisive evidence, taken into account at trial and upon which the conviction depends, was false, forged or falsified;
    <br>
    <br>(c) One or more of the judges who participated in conviction or confirmation of the charges has committed, in that case, an act of serious misconduct or serious breach of duty of sufficient gravity to justify the removal of that judge or those judges from office under article 46.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A84P1"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl006A84P2">2. The Appeals Chamber shall reject the application if it considers it to be unfounded. If it determines that the application is meritorious, it may, as appropriate:
    <br>
    <br>(a) Reconvene the original Trial Chamber;
    <br>
    <br>(b) Constitute a new Trial Chamber; or
    <br>
    <br>(c) Retain jurisdiction over the matter, with a view to, after hearing the parties in the manner set forth in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, arriving at a determination on whether the judgement should be revised.

    <br>
    <br>(a) A sentence of imprisonment shall be served in a State designated by the Court from a list of States which have indicated to the Court their willingness to accept sentenced persons.
    <br>
    <br>(b) At the time of declaring its willingness to accept sentenced persons, a State may attach conditions to its acceptance as agreed by the Court and in accordance with this Part.
    <br>
    <br>(c) A State designated in a particular case shall promptly inform the Court whether it accepts the Court's designation.

    <br>
    <br>(a) The State of enforcement shall notify the Court of any circumstances, including the exercise of any conditions agreed under paragraph 1, which could materially affect the terms or extent of the imprisonment. The Court shall be given at least 45 days' notice of any such known or foreseeable circumstances. During this period, the State of enforcement shall take no action that might prejudice its obligations under article 110.
    <br>
    <br>(b) Where the Court cannot agree to the circumstances referred to in subparagraph (a), it shall notify the State of enforcement and proceed in accordance with article 104, paragraph 1.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A103P2"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl006A103P3">3. In exercising its discretion to make a designation under paragraph 1, the Court shall take into account the following:

    <br>
    <br>(b) The application of widely accepted international treaty standards governing the treatment of prisoners;
    <br>

    <br>
    <br>(d) The nationality of the sentenced person;

    <br>(e) Such other factors regarding the circumstances of the crime or the person sentenced, or the effective enforcement of the sentence, as may be appropriate in designating the State of enforcement.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A103P3"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl006A103P4">4. If no State is designated under paragraph 1, the sentence of imprisonment shall be served in a prison facility made available by the host State, in accordance with the conditions set out in the headquarters agreement referred to in article 3, paragraph 2. In such a case, the costs arising out of the enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment shall be borne by the Court.

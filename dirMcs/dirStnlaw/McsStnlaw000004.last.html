    <br>">international law:
    <br>International law is a set of rules and principles that govern the relationships between sovereign states and other international actors, such as international organizations and individuals. It is a complex and dynamic field that encompasses various legal frameworks, treaties, conventions, customary practices, and principles.
    <br>
    <br>Key elements of international law include:
    <br>1. **Sources of International Law:**
    <br>   - **Treaties:** Agreements between states that are binding under international law.
    <br>   - **Customary International Law:** Practices that have developed among states and are accepted as legally binding.
    <br>   - **General Principles of Law:** Legal principles common to various legal systems.
    <br>   - **Judicial Decisions and Scholarly Writings:** These are considered subsidiary sources of international law.
    <br>
    <br>2. **Subjects of International Law:**
    <br>   - **States:** The primary subjects of international law.
    <br>   - **International Organizations:** Entities like the United Nations, International Court of Justice, etc.
    <br>   - **Individuals:** Increasingly, individuals are recognized as having certain rights and responsibilities under international law.
    <br>
    <br>3. **State Sovereignty:**
    <br>   - The principle of state sovereignty is a fundamental aspect of international law, emphasizing the equality of states and their right to govern their internal affairs without external interference.
    <br>
    <br>4. **International Human Rights Law:**
    <br>   - Protects the rights and dignity of individuals globally. Key documents include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and various conventions.
    <br>
    <br>5. **International Humanitarian Law:**
    <br>   - Governs the conduct of armed conflict, aiming to protect civilians and combatants who are no longer taking part in hostilities.
    <br>
    <br>6. **International Environmental Law:**
    <br>   - Addresses global environmental challenges and promotes sustainable development.
    <br>
    <br>7. **International Criminal Law:**
    <br>   - Deals with crimes of an international concern, such as genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.
    <br>
    <br>8. **Use of Force and Peaceful Settlement of Disputes:**
    <br>   - The United Nations Charter regulates the use of force among states and promotes peaceful settlement of disputes.
    <br>
    <br>9. **International Courts and Tribunals:**
    <br>   - Entities like the International Court of Justice (ICJ) adjudicate disputes between states, while other tribunals focus on specific issues like trade or human rights.
    <br>
    <br>10. **Diplomatic and Consular Law:**
    <br>    - Regulates the conduct of states and their representatives in their diplomatic and consular relations.
    <br>
    <br>It's important to note that enforcement mechanisms in international law are often weaker compared to domestic legal systems. Compliance relies heavily on the willingness of states to adhere to their international obligations. The field continues to evolve as new challenges arise in the global community."

    <br>">subjects of international-law:
    <br>The subjects of international law are the entities that have the capacity to bear rights and obligations under international law. These entities include:
    <br>* **States:** States are the primary subjects of international law. They are defined as independent political entities that have control over a defined territory and population. States have the capacity to enter into treaties, to make war and peace, and to send and receive diplomatic representatives.
    <br>* **International organizations:** International organizations are entities that are created by states to cooperate on matters of common interest. These organizations can be either governmental or non-governmental. They have the capacity to enter into treaties, to make decisions that are binding on their member states, and to enjoy certain privileges and immunities.
    <br>* **Non-state entities:** Non-state entities are entities that are not states or international organizations. These entities can include individuals, corporations, and other legal entities. Non-state entities can have the capacity to bear rights and obligations under international law, but their capacity is generally more limited than that of states or international organizations. For example, individuals can be brought to trial for international crimes, but they cannot enter into treaties.
    <br>* **Special case entities:** Special case entities are entities that do not fit neatly into the categories of states, international organizations, or non-state entities. These entities can include the Holy See, the Order of Malta, and certain other entities that have been recognized as subjects of international law by the international community.
    <br>
    <br>The status of subjects of international law is important because it determines which entities can be held responsible for violations of international law. It also determines which entities can enjoy the rights and privileges that are protected by international law.
    <br>
    <br>The traditional view of the subjects of international law was that only states could be subjects of international law. However, in recent years, there has been a growing recognition that other entities, such as international organizations, non-state entities, and individuals, can also be subjects of international law. This recognition is reflected in the development of new bodies of international law, such as international human rights law and international criminal law.
    <br>
    <br>The development of the concept of the subjects of international law is an ongoing process. As the international community becomes more complex, new entities will emerge that may need to be recognized as subjects of international law."

    <br>">International-court-of-justice:
    <br>The International Court of Justice (ICJ), also known as the World Court, is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations (UN). It settles disputes between states in accordance with international law and gives advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by authorized United Nations organs and specialized agencies.
    <br>
    <br>**Jurisdiction**
    <br>The ICJ has jurisdiction to hear cases between states that have accepted its jurisdiction. States may accept the ICJ's jurisdiction by making a declaration under Article 36 of the ICJ Statute or by agreeing to its jurisdiction in a specific case. The ICJ may also hear cases between states that are parties to a treaty that provides for the settlement of disputes by the ICJ.
    <br>
    <br>**Procedure**
    <br>Cases before the ICJ are initiated by the filing of a written application with the Registry of the Court. The application must be filed by a state that is a party to the dispute. Once the application has been filed, the Registry of the Court sends a copy of it to the other state or states that are parties to the dispute. The other state or states then have a period of time to file a written reply to the application.
    <br>Once the pleadings have been exchanged, the ICJ may hold a hearing on the case. The hearing is an opportunity for the parties to present their arguments to the Court in person. The Court may also ask questions of the parties and their representatives.
    <br>After the hearing, the ICJ closes the case for deliberation. The Court then deliberates in private and reaches a decision by a majority vote. The decision of the Court is final and binding on the parties to the dispute.
    <br>
    <br>**Advisory opinions**
    <br>The ICJ may also give advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by authorized United Nations organs and specialized agencies. These opinions are not binding, but they are influential sources of international law.
    <br>
    <br>**The role of the ICJ**
    <br>The ICJ plays an important role in the international legal system. It is a court of last resort for states that are unable to resolve their disputes through other means. The ICJ's decisions help to develop and clarify international law. The Court's advisory opinions also provide guidance to the United Nations and its specialized agencies.
    <br>The ICJ is a permanent and independent court. Its judges are elected by the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council. The judges are independent of their governments and serve on the Court for a term of nine years.
    <br>The ICJ is located in The Hague, Netherlands. The Court's official languages are English and French.
    <br>
    <br>**Conclusion**
    <br>The ICJ is an important institution in the international legal system. It plays a vital role in the settlement of international disputes and the development of international law. The Court's work helps to promote peace and justice in the world.

    <br>">jurisdiction of International-Court-of-Justice
    <br>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. It is the only international court with jurisdiction over states to resolve legal disputes between them. The ICJ's jurisdiction is both contentious and advisory.
    <br>
    <br>**Contentious Jurisdiction**
    <br>The ICJ's contentious jurisdiction is exercised in accordance with international law and allows states to bring legal disputes against each other. There are two main ways for a state to refer a dispute to the ICJ:
    <br>1. **Voluntary submission:** A state can agree to submit a particular dispute to the ICJ by signing a special agreement, known as a compromis, with the other state involved in the dispute.
    <br>2. **Declarations under Article 36(2) of the Statute:** States may also make a declaration recognizing the compulsory jurisdiction of the ICJ for certain categories of disputes. This means that they agree to submit to the ICJ's jurisdiction without having to sign a special agreement each time a dispute arises.
    <br>The ICJ's contentious jurisdiction is limited to disputes between states. It cannot hear cases between individuals or non-state entities. Additionally, the ICJ's jurisdiction is based on consent, meaning that both parties to a dispute must agree to submit it to the Court for adjudication.
    <br>
    <br>**Advisory Jurisdiction**
    <br>The ICJ's advisory jurisdiction is exercised at the request of authorized United Nations organs or specialized agencies. The Court is asked to provide an opinion on legal questions that are relevant to the work of the requesting body. Advisory opinions are not binding, but they can be influential in shaping international law.
    <br>In order for the ICJ to exercise its advisory jurisdiction, the following conditions must be met:
    <br>1. **The requesting body must be authorized to make the request:** Only the Security Council, the General Assembly, and certain specialized agencies are authorized to request an advisory opinion from the ICJ.
    <br>2. **The question put to the ICJ must be of a legal nature:** The question must be capable of being resolved by the application of legal principles and rules.
    <br>3. **The question must not be of a political nature:** The question must not be primarily concerned with matters of policy or expediency.
    <br>4. **The question must not be one that the Court is not already seized of, or that the Court has already decided in a previous advisory opinion:** The Court will not provide an advisory opinion on a question that it has already ruled on, or that is pending before the Court in contentious proceedings.
    <br>The ICJ's advisory jurisdiction has been used to address a wide range of legal questions, including the interpretation of treaties, the legality of international acts, and the status of individuals in international law. Advisory opinions can be a valuable tool for clarifying international law and promoting its development.
    <br>
    <br>In summary, the International Court of Justice has two main types of jurisdiction: contentious and advisory. Contentious jurisdiction allows states to bring legal disputes against each other, while advisory jurisdiction allows the Court to provide opinions on legal questions at the request of authorized United Nations organs or specialized agencies."

    <br>">International-Criminal-Court:
    <br>The International Criminal Court (ICC) is the first and only permanent, treaty-based international criminal court that investigates and prosecutes individuals accused of the most serious crimes of international concern, namely genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression. The ICC is a court of last resort, meaning it can only intervene if national courts are unwilling or unable to genuinely prosecute these crimes.
    <br>
    <br>**Here are some of the key facts about the ICC:**
    <br>* **Established:** 2002
    <br>* **Headquarters:** The Hague, Netherlands
    <br>* **Number of member states:** 123
    <br>* **Jurisdiction:** The ICC can investigate and prosecute crimes committed on the territory of a member state, or by a national of a member state.
    <br>
    <br>**The ICC has investigated and prosecuted crimes in a number of countries, including:**
    <br>* **Africa:** Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan, Uganda, Central African Republic, Cτte d'Ivoire, Kenya, Mali, Libya, Burundi, and South Sudan
    <br>* **Asia:** Afghanistan, Iraq, Georgia, and the Philippines
    <br>* **Europe:** Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo, Georgia, and Ukraine
    <br>* **Americas:** Colombia, Guatemala, and Honduras
    <br>
    <br>**The ICC has faced a number of challenges, including:**
    <br>* **Limited cooperation from some states:** Some states, such as the United States, are not members of the ICC and have not cooperated with its investigations.
    <br>* **Resource constraints:** The ICC is a relatively new institution and has limited resources. This has made it difficult to investigate and prosecute all of the cases that it has been referred.
    <br>* **Lack of enforcement power:** The ICC does not have its own police force or prisons. It relies on member states to cooperate with its arrest warrants and to enforce its sentences.
    <br>
    <br>Despite these challenges, the ICC has made a significant contribution to the fight against impunity for the most serious crimes of international concern. It has brought justice to victims, deterred future crimes, and helped to strengthen the rule of law.

    <br>"The International Criminal Court (ICC or ICCt)[2] is an intergovernmental organization and international tribunal that sits in The Hague, Netherlands. The ICC is the first and only permanent international court with jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for the international crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression. It is intended to complement existing national judicial systems and it may therefore exercise its jurisdiction only when national courts are unwilling or unable to prosecute criminals. The ICC lacks universal territorial jurisdiction, and may only investigate and prosecute crimes committed within member states, crimes committed by nationals of member states, or crimes in situations referred to the Court by the United Nations Security Council.
    <br>The ICC began operations on 1 July 2002, upon the entry into force of the Rome Statute, a multilateral treaty that serves as the court's foundational and governing document. States which become party to the Rome Statute become members of the ICC, serving on the Assembly of States Parties, which administers the court. As of December 2020, there are 123 ICC member states; 42 states have neither signed nor become parties to the Rome Statute."

    <br>">evolution of international-criminal-court:
    <br>The evolution of the International Criminal Court (ICC) can be traced back to the atrocities committed during World War II, which sparked the establishment of the Nuremberg and Tokyo Tribunals. These tribunals, while groundbreaking in their own right, were ad hoc courts limited to specific conflicts and perpetrators. The desire for a permanent international criminal court emerged to address the most serious crimes of international concern, regardless of where or when they were committed.
    <br>
    <br>In 1948, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, marking a significant step towards establishing an international criminal justice system. However, the idea of a permanent ICC remained elusive for decades due to political and legal challenges.
    <br>
    <br>A breakthrough came in 1998 when 120 states adopted the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the legal basis for establishing the ICC. The Rome Statute defined the ICC's jurisdiction, powers, and procedures, and established the crimes that the ICC could prosecute.
    <br>
    <br>The ICC officially came into force on July 1, 2002, with 60 states becoming parties to the Rome Statute. Since then, the ICC has evolved into a crucial institution in the pursuit of international criminal justice.
    <br>
    <br>Key milestones in the evolution of the ICC include:
    <br>1. **Establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Establishment of an International Criminal Court (1995):** This committee was tasked with preparing a draft statute for an ICC, which eventually formed the basis for the Rome Statute.
    <br>
    <br>2. **Adoption of the Rome Statute (1998):** The adoption of the Rome Statute marked a major turning point, establishing the legal framework for the ICC.
    <br>
    <br>3. **Entry into force of the Rome Statute (2002):** With the ratification of the Rome Statute by 60 states, the ICC officially came into existence.
    <br>
    <br>4. **Opening of the ICC's headquarters in The Hague (2003):** The ICC established its permanent headquarters in The Hague, Netherlands.
    <br>
    <br>5. **Issuance of the first arrest warrant (2006):** The ICC issued its first arrest warrant for Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, a Congolese warlord accused of recruiting and using child soldiers.
    <br>
    <br>6. **First convictions (2012):** The ICC handed down its first convictions against Thomas Lubanga Dyilo and Germain Katanga, both Congolese warlords.
    <br>
    <br>7. **Opening of investigations in new regions (2015-present):** The ICC expanded its investigations to include situations in Latin America, Asia, and the Middle East.
    <br>
    <br>8. **Adoption of the crime of aggression (2017):** The ICC amended its Rome Statute to include the crime of aggression, a significant step in addressing the most serious crime under international law.
    <br>
    <br>The ICC continues to evolve, facing challenges and opportunities as it strives to fulfill its mandate of upholding international criminal justice. The court's ability to investigate and prosecute the most serious crimes of international concern, regardless of where or when they were committed, has set a precedent for international criminal justice.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInlenfmH2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idLawInlenfmdsn">description::
    <br>">enforcement of international-law:
    <br>The enforcement of international law is a complex and multifaceted issue. Unlike domestic law, which is enforced by a centralized authority with a monopoly on violence, international law is enforced through a decentralized system of self-help, cooperation, and institutions. This means that there is no single body or mechanism that is responsible for enforcing international law, and the effectiveness of enforcement varies depending on the specific norm, the parties involved, and the circumstances of the case.
    <br>**Self-help** is the most common method of enforcing international law. This means that states take action themselves to ensure that other states comply with international law. Self-help measures can be diplomatic, such as protest or suspension of relations, or they can be economic, such as sanctions or boycotts. In some cases, states may even resort to the use of force to enforce international law.
    <br>**Cooperation** is also an important factor in the enforcement of international law. States often work together to enforce international law through treaties, international organizations, and other multilateral mechanisms. For example, the United Nations Security Council can authorize the use of force to enforce international law, and the International Criminal Court can prosecute individuals for serious violations of international law.
    <br>**Institutions** play a crucial role in the enforcement of international law. These institutions can provide a forum for states to resolve disputes, monitor compliance with international law, and impose sanctions on states that violate international law. Some of the most important international institutions for the enforcement of international law include the International Court of Justice, the World Trade Organization, and the International Monetary Fund.
    <br>
    <br>The enforcement of international law is often challenging, but it is essential for maintaining a rules-based order in the international system. Without effective enforcement, international law would be nothing more than a set of empty promises.
    <br>
    <br>Here are some of the specific methods that are used to enforce international law:
    <br>* **Diplomatic measures:** These measures include protest, suspension of relations, and diplomatic isolation.
    <br>* **Economic measures:** These measures include sanctions, boycotts, and asset freezes.
    <br>* **Judicial measures:** These measures involve bringing cases against states or individuals who have violated international law.
    <br>* **Use of force:** This is a measure of last resort and is only authorized under international law in very limited circumstances.
    <br>
    <br>The effectiveness of international law enforcement varies depending on the specific norm, the parties involved, and the circumstances of the case. Some norms are more easily enforced than others, and states are more likely to comply with international law when they are powerful and have a strong interest in the norm being enforced.
    <br>
    <br>In recent years, there have been a number of initiatives to strengthen the enforcement of international law. These initiatives include the creation of new international courts and tribunals, the development of new enforcement mechanisms, and the increased use of sanctions and other punitive measures.
    <br>
    <br>Despite these efforts, the enforcement of international law remains a challenge. This is due to a number of factors, including the decentralized nature of the international system, the reluctance of states to use force, and the lack of a centralized enforcement authority. However, there is a growing recognition of the importance of international law, and there is a renewed commitment to strengthening its enforcement."

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInlevgFH1"></a></h1>
  <p id="idLawInlevgFdsn">description::
    <br>">evolution of international-law:
    <br>Sure, here is a summary of the evolution of international law:
    <br>
    <br>**Early Origins**
    <br>The roots of international law can be traced back to ancient civilizations, where treaties and customary practices governed interactions between states. However, it was in Europe that international law truly began to develop, driven by the need to manage relations between increasingly interconnected states.
    <br>
    <br>**Emergence of Modern International Law**
    <br>The Peace of Westphalia, concluded in 1648, marked a turning point in the development of international law. The treaty established the principle of state sovereignty, which laid the foundation for the modern international legal system.
    <br>
    <br>**Hugo Grotius and the Rise of Natural Law**
    <br>Hugo Grotius, a Dutch jurist, is widely considered the father of international law. His seminal work, "De Jure Belli ac Pacis" (On the Law of War and Peace), published in 1625, laid out the foundations of natural law, which posited that international law was derived from universal moral principles.
    <br>
    <br>**Positivism and the Rise of State Consent**
    <br>In the 19th century, positivism emerged as the dominant theory of international law. Positivists argued that international law was not based on natural law but rather on the consent of states. This shift reflected the growing importance of state sovereignty and the development of treaties as the primary source of international law.
    <br>
    <br>**The Hague Conventions and the Codification of International Law**
    <br>The Hague Conventions, held in 1899 and 1907, were a landmark in the codification of international law. The conventions addressed a range of issues, including the conduct of warfare and the protection of neutral states.
    <br>
    <br>**The League of Nations and the Rise of International Institutions**
    <br>The establishment of the League of Nations in 1920 marked a new era in international law. The League was the first permanent international organization dedicated to maintaining peace and security. It also played a role in codifying international law through conventions and treaties.
    <br>
    <br>**The United Nations and the Post-World War II Era**
    <br>The United Nations, established in 1945, replaced the League of Nations and became the central forum for international cooperation and lawmaking. The UN Charter enshrines key principles of international law, such as the prohibition of the use of force and the peaceful settlement of disputes.
    <br>
    <br>**Contemporary Developments in International Law**
    <br>International law has continued to evolve in the post-Cold War era, addressing new challenges such as globalization, environmental protection, and human rights. International institutions, such as the World Trade Organization and the International Criminal Court, have also emerged to play an increasingly important role in upholding international law.
    <br>
    <br>**Key Themes in the Evolution of International Law**
    <br>The evolution of international law has been shaped by several key themes:
    <br>* **Sovereignty:** The principle of state sovereignty has been central to the development of international law.
    <br>* **Consent:** The principle of state consent is the basis for the creation of international obligations.
    <br>* **Codification:** The codification of international law into treaties and conventions has provided greater clarity and certainty.
    <br>* **Institutionalization:** International institutions have played an increasingly important role in upholding international law.
    <br>* **Emerging Challenges:** International law is constantly evolving to address new challenges, such as globalization, environmental protection, and human rights.
    <br>
    <br>**Conclusion**
    <br>International law has played a crucial role in promoting cooperation, maintaining peace, and protecting human rights in the global arena. As the world continues to face complex and interconnected challenges, international law will remain an essential tool for managing relations between states and upholding the rule of law."

    <br>">evolution of international-law:
    <br>The evolution of international law is a complex and dynamic process that has taken place over centuries. It has been shaped by historical events, changes in state practices, and the development of new norms and institutions. Here is a brief overview of key stages in the evolution of international law:
    <br>
    <br>1. **Ancient and Medieval Periods (3000 BCE – 1648 CE):**
    <br>   - During ancient times, various civilizations had systems of customary laws governing relations between states and individuals.
    <br>   - In medieval Europe, the Catholic Church played a significant role in shaping laws and norms, particularly through the concept of "just war" and the idea of a natural law governing human conduct.
    <br>
    <br>2. **Peace of Westphalia (1648):**
    <br>   - The Peace of Westphalia is often considered a foundational moment for modern international law. It ended the Thirty Years' War and marked the beginning of the state-centric system.
    <br>   - The principle of state sovereignty emerged, emphasizing non-intervention in the domestic affairs of sovereign states.
    <br>
    <br>3. **18th and 19th Centuries:**
    <br>   - Emergence of the law of nations and the development of the idea of international legal personality for states.
    <br>   - The publication of legal scholars such as Emer de Vattel contributed to the codification and understanding of international law principles.
    <br>
    <br>4. **Hague Conferences (1899 and 1907):**
    <br>   - The conferences aimed to codify laws of war and establish the Permanent Court of Arbitration, reflecting a growing interest in international cooperation and dispute resolution.
    <br>
    <br>5. **League of Nations (1920):**
    <br>   - The League of Nations was the first international organization with the goal of maintaining peace and preventing conflicts.
    <br>   - It contributed to the development of international law through treaties and agreements.
    <br>
    <br>6. **Post-World War II Era:**
    <br>   - The United Nations (UN) was established in 1945, with its Charter serving as a foundational document of modern international law.
    <br>   - The Nuremberg Trials set important precedents for prosecuting individuals for war crimes and crimes against humanity.
    <br>
    <br>7. **Cold War and Decolonization:**
    <br>   - The Cold War era saw a focus on arms control and the development of treaties addressing issues such as nuclear weapons and the law of the sea.
    <br>   - Decolonization led to the creation of new states, influencing the development of international legal norms.
    <br>
    <br>8. **Contemporary Period:**
    <br>   - The end of the Cold War marked a shift in international relations, with increased emphasis on human rights, humanitarian intervention, and the responsibility to protect (R2P).
    <br>   - International criminal tribunals, such as the International Criminal Court (ICC), were established to prosecute individuals for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.
    <br>
    <br>9. **Globalization and New Challenges:**
    <br>   - Globalization has brought about new challenges, including issues related to the environment, cybersecurity, and transnational crime.
    <br>   - Efforts to address these challenges involve the development of new legal frameworks and mechanisms.
    <br>
    <br>The evolution of international law continues as the international community grapples with contemporary issues and strives to adapt legal norms to the changing global landscape. Ongoing developments include efforts to strengthen international institutions, enhance accountability, and address emerging threats to peace and security."

    <br>**Private international law** is concerned with the relationships between private individuals and entities in different countries. It governs such matters as contracts, torts, and family law. Some of the most important sources of private international law are treaties, custom, and general principles of law.
    <br>
    <br>Here are some of the specific areas of international law:
    <br>* **International economic law** is concerned with the economic relations between states. It governs such matters as trade, investment, and finance.
    <br>* **International security law** is concerned with the use of force by states. It governs such matters as war, self-defense, and nuclear weapons.
    <br>* **International criminal law** is concerned with the prosecution of individuals for crimes such as genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.
    <br>* **International environmental law** is concerned with the protection of the environment. It governs such matters as pollution, climate change, and biodiversity.
    <br>* **Diplomatic law** is concerned with the conduct of relations between states. It governs such matters as immunity, privileges, and ceremonies.
    <br>* **Human rights law** is concerned with the protection of the human rights of individuals. It governs such matters as freedom of expression, freedom of association, and the right to life.
    <br>* **International humanitarian law** is concerned with the protection of individuals during armed conflict. It governs such matters as the use of force, the treatment of prisoners of war, and the protection of civilians.
    <br>* **International law of the sea** is concerned with the use of the oceans. It governs such matters as fishing, navigation, and pollution.
    <br>* **Space law** is concerned with the use of outer space. It governs such matters as the exploration of space, the use of satellites, and the militarization of space."

    <br>">human-rights international-law:
    <br>International human rights law is the body of international law that deals with the protection and promotion of human rights at the international, regional, and domestic levels. It is a complex and evolving field of law that draws on a variety of sources, including treaties, customary international law, general principles of law, and soft law.
    <br>
    <br>**The foundation of international human rights law is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR),** which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948. The UDHR is a non-binding declaration that sets out a broad range of civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights that all human beings are entitled to.
    <br>
    <br>**The UDHR has been supplemented by a number of other treaties,** including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). These treaties are binding on states that have ratified them, and they set out more detailed obligations for states to protect and promote human rights.
    <br>
    <br>**International human rights law also includes a number of customary international law norms,** which are rules of international law that are based on longstanding state practice and opinio juris (the belief that the rule is law). Customary international law norms include the prohibition of torture, genocide, and crimes against humanity.
    <br>
    <br>**In addition to treaties and customary international law, international human rights law also includes a number of soft law instruments,** such as declarations, resolutions, and guidelines. Soft law instruments are not binding on states, but they can still have a significant impact on the development of international human rights law.
    <br>
    <br>**International human rights law is enforced through a variety of mechanisms,** including international courts, tribunals, and human rights monitoring bodies. These mechanisms can investigate allegations of human rights violations and make recommendations to states to improve their human rights records.
    <br>
    <br>**International human rights law is a complex and evolving field of law, but it is also a vitally important one.** It plays a crucial role in protecting the human rights of all people, regardless of their nationality, race, gender, religion, or any other status.
    <br>
    <br>Here are some of the key principles of international human rights law:
    <br>* **Universality:** Human rights are universal, meaning that they apply to all people, everywhere, without discrimination.
    <br>* **Indivisibility:** Human rights are indivisible, meaning that they cannot be ranked or prioritized. All human rights are equally important.
    <br>* **Interdependence:** Human rights are interdependent, meaning that they are all interconnected and reinforce each other.
    <br>* **Non-discrimination:** All human beings are entitled to all human rights without discrimination on any grounds, such as race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.
    <br>* **Equality:** All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.
    <br>* **Accountability:** States are accountable for their actions or omissions in relation to human rights.

    <br>">sea international law:
    <br>The **law of the sea**, also known as the **maritime law**, is a body of customs, treaties, and international agreements that govern activities and legal relationships on the sea. It aims to establish order, maintain peaceful relations, and promote the sustainable use of marine resources.
    <br>
    <br>**Key principles of the law of the sea** include:
    <br>1. **Freedom of navigation:** All ships, regardless of their flag, have the right to innocent passage through territorial waters. This means that they can pass through these waters without stopping or communicating with the coastal state, as long as they do not engage in any activities that could threaten the peace and security of the coastal state.
    <br>2. **Exclusive economic zones (EEZs):** Coastal states have exclusive rights to explore, exploit, conserve, and manage the natural resources within their EEZs, which extend up to 200 nautical miles from their coastlines.
    <br>3. **Deep seabed resources:** The deep seabed, beyond national jurisdiction, is the common heritage of mankind. This means that its resources are owned by all of humanity and must be exploited for the benefit of all. The International Seabed Authority (ISA) was established to regulate the exploitation of deep seabed resources.
    <br>4. **Protection of the marine environment:** The law of the sea requires states to take measures to protect the marine environment from pollution and other harmful activities. This includes preventing marine pollution from ships, land-based sources, and atmospheric sources.
    <br>5. **Peaceful uses of the sea:** The law of the sea prohibits the use of the sea for hostile purposes, such as the threat or use of force. It also establishes rules for the settlement of maritime disputes.
    <br>
    <br>The **primary source of the law of the sea** is the **United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea** (UNCLOS), which was adopted in 1982 and entered into force in 1994. UNCLOS is the most comprehensive and widely accepted treaty on the law of the sea.
    <br>
    <br>In addition to UNCLOS, there are a number of other treaties and agreements that govern specific aspects of maritime law, such as fishing, conservation, and maritime transportation.
    <br>
    <br>The law of the sea is a dynamic and evolving field of law. As new uses are developed for the sea, and as the marine environment changes, the law of the sea must adapt to meet these new challenges.
    <br>
    <br>Here are some of the **recent developments in the law of the sea:**
    <br>* The increasing importance of **transboundary marine resources**, such as fish stocks and marine mammals, is leading to calls for greater international cooperation in their management.
    <br>* The growing problem of **marine pollution** is prompting states to adopt stricter regulations and enforcement measures.
    <br>* The development of new technologies, such as deep seabed mining, is raising concerns about the impact on the marine environment and the distribution of benefits.
    <br>
    <br>The law of the sea plays a crucial role in ensuring that the oceans are used sustainably and peacefully for the benefit of all humanity. As the world becomes more interconnected, the need for a strong and effective legal framework for the sea is becoming increasingly important."

    <br>">space international-law:
    <br>International space law, also known as space law, is a framework of international treaties and custom that governs the exploration, use, and protection of outer space. These laws were developed to ensure that space activities are conducted in a safe, responsible, and sustainable manner for the benefit of all humankind.
    <br>
    <br>**Key Principles of International Space Law**
    <br>* **Non-appropriation of outer space:** No country or entity may claim sovereignty over any part of outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies.
    <br>* **Peaceful use of outer space:** Outer space is to be used for peaceful purposes only, and the threat or use of force is prohibited.
    <br>* **Free access to all areas of celestial bodies:** All countries have the right to explore and use the Moon and other celestial bodies without discrimination.
    <br>* **Cooperation:** States are encouraged to cooperate in the exploration and use of outer space for the benefit of all.
    <br>* **Liability for damage caused by space objects:** States are responsible for any damage caused by their space objects in orbit or on the ground.
    <br>* **Protection of the environment:** States are responsible for preventing the contamination of outer space and celestial bodies.
    <br>
    <br>**Major International Space Treaties**
    <br>* **Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (Outer Space Treaty)**: This treaty, which entered into force in 1967, is the cornerstone of international space law. It establishes the basic principles of non-appropriation, peaceful use, and free access to outer space.
    <br>* **Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts, the Return of Astronauts and the Return of Objects Launched into Outer Space (Rescue Agreement)**: This treaty, which entered into force in 1968, provides for the rescue and return of astronauts and spacecraft in distress.
    <br>* **Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects (Liability Convention)**: This treaty, which entered into force in 1972, establishes a system of liability for damage caused by space objects.
    <br>* **Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space (Registration Convention)**: This treaty, which entered into force in 1975, requires states to register all space objects launched from their territory.
    <br>* **Moon Agreement:** This treaty, which has not yet entered into force, prohibits the militarization of the Moon and other celestial bodies and provides for the equitable sharing of resources extracted from these bodies.
    <br>
    <br>**Challenges in International Space Law**
    <br>As space exploration and technology advance, new challenges are emerging for international space law. These challenges include:
    <br>* **The commercialization of space:** The increasing involvement of private companies in space activities is raising questions about the application of international space law to these activities.
    <br>* **The exploration and exploitation of natural resources in outer space:** The potential for mining resources from asteroids and other celestial bodies is raising concerns about the equitable distribution of these resources and the environmental impact of their extraction.
    <br>* **The militarization of space:** The development of new weapons systems that could be used in space is a concern for many states and international organizations.
    <br>
    <br>International space law is constantly evolving as new challenges arise. The United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) is the main forum for international cooperation on space law. UNOOSA, the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs, provides administrative and technical support to COPUOS and other UN activities related to space law.
    <br>
    <br>The future of international space law is uncertain, but it is clear that it will play an increasingly important role in ensuring that space activities are conducted in a safe, responsible, and sustainable manner for the benefit of all humankind.

    <br>">state responsibility international-law:
    <br>State responsibility is a branch of international law that deals with the legal consequences of a state's breach of an international obligation. The principles of state responsibility are designed to ensure that states are held accountable for their actions and that victims of breaches are compensated for the harm they have suffered.
    <br>
    <br>**The Draft Articles on State Responsibility**, adopted by the International Law Commission (ILC) in 2001, are the most authoritative statement of the principles of state responsibility. The Articles define an internationally wrongful act as a conduct consisting of a breach of an international obligation by a state. The Articles also set out the conditions under which a state is responsible for an internationally wrongful act and the consequences of such an act.
    <br>
    <br>**The main principles of state responsibility are:**
    <br>* **Attribution:** A state is responsible for an internationally wrongful act only if the act is attributable to it. This means that the act must have been committed by the state or by a person or entity that is acting on the state's behalf.
    <br>* **Breach of an international obligation:** A state is responsible for an internationally wrongful act only if it breaches an international obligation. This means that the state must have a legal duty to act or refrain from acting in a certain way.
    <br>* **Injury:** A state is responsible for an internationally wrongful act only if the act causes injury to another state or to its nationals. This means that the act must have caused some harm or loss to the victim.
    <br>
    <br>**The consequences of an internationally wrongful act are:**
    <br>* **Cessation of the wrongful act:** The state responsible for the internationally wrongful act must cease the act if it is continuing.
    <br>* **Reparation:** The state responsible for the internationally wrongful act must make reparation for the injury caused by the act. This means that the state must compensate the victim for the harm or loss that it has suffered.
    <br>* **Satisfaction:** The state responsible for the internationally wrongful act must give satisfaction to the victim. This means that the state must acknowledge the breach and express regret for the harm caused.
    <br>
    <br>**The principles of state responsibility are important because they:**
    <br>* **Hold states accountable for their actions:** The principles ensure that states are not able to act with impunity and that they must take responsibility for their breaches of international law.
    <br>* **Protect the rights of states and their nationals:** The principles provide a framework for states to seek redress for breaches of international law and to compensate victims for the harm they have suffered.
    <br>* **Promote the rule of law:** The principles contribute to the development of a stable and orderly international legal system.
    <br>
    <br>**State responsibility is a complex and evolving area of international law. The principles of state responsibility are constantly being developed and refined by international courts and tribunals, by the ILC, and by scholars.**"

    <br>">international law of war:
    <br>International humanitarian law (IHL), also known as the law of armed conflict, is a body of law that regulates the conduct of hostilities and seeks to limit the suffering caused by armed conflict. IHL applies to all parties to an armed conflict, whether they are states or non-state actors.
    <br>
    <br>The main principles of IHL are:
    <br>* **Humanity:** Civilians and combatants who are no longer taking part in hostilities must be treated humanely. This means that they must not be killed, tortured, or subjected to other forms of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.
    <br>* **Distinction:** Civilians and civilian objects must be distinguished from combatants and military objectives. Attacks must be directed only at military objectives, and civilians must not be deliberately targeted.
    <br>* **Proportionality:** The expected military advantage of an attack must outweigh the expected civilian harm. Attacks that are likely to cause excessive civilian harm are prohibited.
    <br>* **Precautions in attack:** Parties to an armed conflict must take all feasible precautions to minimize civilian harm. This includes taking measures to avoid civilian casualties, such as giving advance warning of attacks.
    <br>
    <br>IHL is based on a number of treaties and conventions, including the Geneva Conventions, the Hague Conventions, and the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions. These treaties and conventions have been ratified by most countries in the world.
    <br>
    <br>IHL is enforced by a number of bodies, including the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the United Nations Security Council, and national courts. The ICRC is a humanitarian organization that works to protect the lives and dignity of people affected by armed conflict. The United Nations Security Council has the power to authorize the use of force and to impose sanctions on countries that violate IHL. National courts can prosecute individuals for war crimes, which are serious violations of IHL.
    <br>
    <br>IHL is an important tool for protecting civilians and limiting the suffering caused by armed conflict. It is a complex body of law, but it is essential for ensuring that armed conflicts are conducted in a humane manner."

    <br>"Customary international law is an aspect of international law involving the principle of custom. Along with general principles of law and treaties, custom is considered by the International Court of Justice, jurists, the United Nations, and its member states to be among the primary sources of international law.
    <br>Many governments accept in principle the existence of customary international law, although there are differing opinions as to what rules are contained in it.
    <br>In 1950, the International Law Commission listed the following sources as forms of evidence of customary international law: treaties, decisions of national and international courts, national legislation, opinions of national legal advisors, diplomatic correspondence, and practice of international organizations.[1] In 2018, the Commission adopted Conclusions on Identification of Customary International Law with commentaries.[2] The United Nations General Assembly welcomed the Conclusions and encouraged their widest possible dissemination.[3]"

    <br>">international treaty:
    <br>An **international treaty**, or **international agreement**, is a legal instrument that establishes a formal relationship between two or more states or international organizations. Treaties are governed by international law and are binding on the parties to the treaty. They are an important tool for regulating international relations and promoting cooperation among states.
    <br>
    <br>**Key characteristics of international treaties:**
    <br>* **Written form:** Treaties are typically written documents that are signed and ratified by the parties involved.
    <br>* **Governed by international law:** Treaties are subject to the rules of international law, which are set out in treaties and other international instruments.
    <br>* **Binding on the parties:** Treaties create legal obligations for the parties that are involved. These obligations must be fulfilled in good faith.
    <br>
    <br>**Types of international treaties:**
    <br>* **Multilateral treaties:** These treaties are between three or more states. For example, the United Nations Charter is a multilateral treaty.
    <br>* **Bilateral treaties:** These treaties are between two states. For example, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is a bilateral treaty.
    <br>
    <br>**Purposes of international treaties:**
    <br>* **Promote peace and security:** Treaties can help to prevent wars and resolve conflicts between states. For example, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is a treaty that aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.
    <br>* **Encourage cooperation:** Treaties can promote cooperation between states on a range of issues, such as trade, the environment, and human rights. For example, the Paris Agreement is a treaty that aims to address climate change.
    <br>* **Resolve disputes:** Treaties can provide a framework for resolving disputes between states. For example, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) is a court that can hear disputes between states that are based on treaties.
    <br>
    <br>**Examples of important international treaties:**
    <br>* **Treaty of Westphalia (1648):** This treaty ended the Thirty Years' War and established the modern system of sovereign states.
    <br>* **Convention on the Law of the Sea (1982):** This treaty governs the use of the oceans and establishes a legal framework for maritime navigation and resource exploitation.
    <br>* **Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948):** This declaration sets out the fundamental rights and freedoms that all people are entitled to.
    <br>* **Paris Agreement (2015):** This treaty aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels.
    <br>
    <br>**International treaties play a vital role in maintaining international peace and security, promoting cooperation and resolving disputes between states. They are an essential part of the international legal system and have a significant impact on the lives of people around the world.**

    <br>">Hague-conventions:
    <br>The Hague Conventions are a series of multilateral treaties and declarations negotiated at two international peace conferences held at The Hague in the Netherlands in 1899 and 1907. The conventions codified the laws and customs of war, making them the first comprehensive attempt to regulate armed conflict.
    <br>
    <br>The conventions established a number of important principles, including:
    <br>* The obligation to distinguish between combatants and non-combatants
    <br>* The prohibition of indiscriminate attacks
    <br>* The protection of civilians and civilian objects
    <br>* The treatment of prisoners of war
    <br>* The prohibition of certain weapons
    <br>
    <br>The Hague Conventions have been widely ratified and have become part of customary international law. They have been instrumental in preventing the escalation of violence and protecting civilians during armed conflicts.
    <br>Here are some of the key Hague Conventions:
    <br>* **Hague Convention (I) for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes (1899)**: This convention established the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the first international court for the peaceful settlement of disputes.
    <br>* **Hague Convention (II) for the Reduction of Armaments** (1899): This convention called for the limitation of the size of armies and navies.
    <br>* **Hague Convention (III) on the Opening of Hostilities** (1899 and 1907): This convention specifies the formal declaration of war and bans surprise attacks.
    <br>* **Hague Convention (IV) on the Laws and Customs of War on Land** (1899 and 1907): This convention establishes rules governing the conduct of hostilities on land, including the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks, the protection of civilians and civilian objects, and the treatment of prisoners of war.
    <br>* **Hague Convention (VI) on the Status of Enemy Merchant Ships at the Outbreak of Hostilities** (1907): This convention provides for the protection of merchant ships belonging to belligerents from capture by the enemy during the first two weeks of a war.
    <br>* **Hague Convention (IX) on Bombardment by Naval Forces in Time of War** (1907): This convention restricts the use of naval bombardment against coastal towns and villages, requiring that such attacks be directed against military objectives.
    <br>
    <br>The Hague Conventions have been instrumental in promoting international cooperation and preventing the escalation of violence. They remain of great importance today, as they provide a framework for regulating armed conflict and protecting civilians."

  <p id="idLawInl011dsn">description::
    <br>">Geneva conventions:
    <br>The Geneva Conventions are a series of four international treaties and three additional protocols that establish international legal standards for humanitarian treatment in war. They were first adopted in 1864, and have been revised and expanded several times since then. The Geneva Conventions apply in all international and non-international armed conflicts, and they protect people who are not taking part in the hostilities (civilians, medics, and aid workers), as well as those who are no longer participating in the hostilities, such as wounded, sick, and shipwrecked soldiers and prisoners of war.
    <br>
    <br>**Key Principles of the Geneva Conventions**
    <br>* **Humanity:** The Geneva Conventions are based on the principle of humanity, which means that they aim to protect the lives and dignity of individuals during armed conflict.
    <br>* **Impartiality:** The Geneva Conventions must be applied impartially, without discrimination of any kind, such as race, color, religion, sex, birth, or wealth.
    <br>* **Neutrality:** The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the leading organization responsible for upholding the Geneva Conventions, must remain neutral in all its activities.
    <br>
    <br>**Protections Under the Geneva Conventions**
    <br>The Geneva Conventions provide a range of protections for people affected by armed conflict, including:
    <br>* **Protection from violence and abuse:** Civilians, medical personnel, and aid workers must be protected from violence and abuse, including torture, cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.
    <br>* **Access to medical care:** All wounded and sick people, without distinction, must be given access to medical care.
    <br>* **Preservation of cultural property:** Cultural property, such as museums, libraries, and religious buildings, must be protected from destruction or damage.
    <br>* **Repatriation of prisoners of war:** Prisoners of war must be released and repatriated at the end of hostilities.
    <br>
    <br>**Challenges to Implementing the Geneva Conventions**
    <br>Despite their importance, the Geneva Conventions face a number of challenges in being implemented fully. These challenges include:
    <br>* **Violations of the Conventions:** Parties to armed conflicts often violate the Geneva Conventions, either intentionally or unintentionally.
    <br>* **Lack of accountability:** There is often a lack of accountability for violations of the Geneva Conventions, which makes it difficult to deter future violations.
    <br>* **Difficulties in accessing conflict zones:** It can be difficult for humanitarian organizations to access conflict zones to provide assistance to those who need it.
    <br>
    <br>Despite these challenges, the Geneva Conventions remain an essential framework for protecting human life and dignity during armed conflict. They are an important reminder that even in the midst of war, there are basic standards of humanity that must be upheld.

    <br>">international convention vs treaty:
    <br>The terms "international convention" and "treaty" are often used interchangeably, but there is a subtle difference between the two.
    <br>
    <br>**Legally, there is no difference between an international convention and a treaty.** Both are legally binding agreements between states that are governed by international law. They are entered into for a variety of purposes, such as regulating international trade, establishing diplomatic relations, or protecting human rights.
    <br>
    <br>**The main difference between the two terms is that "convention" is typically used for formal multilateral treaties with a broad number of parties, while "treaty" is a more general term that can be used for any kind of international agreement, regardless of the number of parties involved.** For example, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is a multilateral treaty with 168 parties, while the Paris Agreement on climate change is a multilateral treaty with 196 parties.
    <br>
    <br>In practice, the terms "convention" and "treaty" are often used interchangeably, and there is no need to be pedantic about which term to use. However, if you are writing a formal document, it is always best to use the term that is most appropriate for the context.
    <br>
    <br>Here is a table summarizing the key differences between international conventions and treaties:
    <br>| Feature | International Convention | Treaty |
    <br>| **Used for** | Formal multilateral treaties with a broad number of parties | Any kind of international agreement, regardless of the number of parties involved |
    <br>| **Tendency** | Used for treaties that deal with important or sensitive issues | Used for all types of treaties |
    <br>| **Examples** | United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea | Paris Agreement on climate change |"

    <br>">general principles of international-law:
    <br>General principles of international law are fundamental norms that are recognized and accepted by the international community of states. They are considered to be part of customary international law, which is a source of international law that is based on long-standing and generally accepted practices of states. General principles of international law are often used to fill gaps in the law or to interpret other sources of international law.
    <br>
    <br>Some of the most important general principles of international law include:
    <br>* **Sovereign equality of states:** All states are equal and independent, and no state has the right to interfere in the internal affairs of another state.
    <br>* **Pacta sunt servanda:** Treaties must be observed in good faith.
    <br>* **Nullus crimen sine lege:** There is no crime without law.
    <br>* **Aut in deroga aut non:** A state cannot rely on its own internal law to justify a breach of international law.
    <br>* **Res judicata:** A matter that has been judicially decided cannot be relitigated.
    <br>* **Estoppel:** A state is bound by its own representations.
    <br>* **Good faith:** States must act in good faith in their relations with other states.
    <br>* **Equity:** States must act in a fair and equitable manner.
    <br>* **Justice:** States must uphold justice in their relations with other states.
    <br>
    <br>General principles of international law are an important source of international law and are used to promote the rule of law in the international system. They provide a framework for states to interact with each other in a peaceful and cooperative manner.
    <br>
    <br>Here are some examples of how general principles of international law have been applied:
    <br>* In the case of the *Interhandel Case*, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) held that the principle of pacta sunt servanda required Switzerland to comply with a treaty it had signed with the United States, even though the Swiss Federal Council had declared the treaty null and void.
    <br>* In the case of the *Fisheries Jurisdiction Case*, the ICJ held that the principle of good faith required Iceland to negotiate with the United Kingdom in order to reach an agreement on fishing quotas, even though Iceland had not violated any specific international law provision.
    <br>* In the case of the *Oil Platforms Case*, the ICJ held that the principle of estoppel prevented Iran from relying on its own internal law to justify its seizure of oil platforms owned by the United States.
    <br>
    <br>General principles of international law are a dynamic and evolving source of international law. They are constantly being developed and refined by the international community of states."

    <br>">judicial-dicisions of international-law:
    <br>Judicial decisions play a significant role in international law, serving as a secondary source of law and providing valuable insights into the interpretation and application of international legal norms. While not formally binding on subsequent disputes, judicial decisions are often persuasive and can shape the development of international law in various ways.
    <br>
    <br>**Primary and Secondary Sources of International Law**
    <br>International law is primarily derived from treaties, customary international law, and general principles of law. These sources are considered primary sources, as they directly establish legal norms. Judicial decisions, on the other hand, are categorized as secondary sources, meaning they interpret and apply primary sources to specific cases.
    <br>
    <br>**Role of Judicial Decisions in International Law**
    <br>Despite their secondary status, judicial decisions hold considerable influence in international law. They serve several key functions:
    <br>1. **Evidence of Customary International Law:** Judicial decisions can provide evidence of state practice, opinio juris (belief in the legal bindingness of a norm), and the general acceptance of a customary rule.
    <br>2. **Interpretation of Treaties:** Courts and tribunals play a crucial role in interpreting treaty provisions, resolving ambiguities, and determining the scope of treaty obligations.
    <br>3. **Development of International Law:** Judicial decisions can contribute to the development of international law by identifying new legal principles, expanding the scope of existing norms, and refining the interpretation of international legal instruments.
    <br>
    <br>**Persuasive Value of Judicial Decisions**
    <br>The persuasive value of judicial decisions varies depending on the court or tribunal issuing the decision, the quality of its reasoning, and the consistency with other judicial decisions. Decisions from courts with higher authority, such as the International Court of Justice (ICJ), carry greater weight than those from lower courts or specialized tribunals.
    <br>
    <br>**Stare Decisis in International Law**
    <br>Unlike national legal systems that adhere to the principle of stare decisis, which requires courts to follow precedents set by higher courts, international law does not have a formal doctrine of stare decisis. However, courts and tribunals often give significant deference to the decisions of higher courts and influential tribunals, particularly when they address similar legal issues.
    <br>
    <br>**Impact of Judicial Decisions**
    <br>Judicial decisions can have a significant impact on the international legal landscape, affecting the behavior of states, influencing the interpretation of international legal norms, and shaping the development of international law. While not formally binding, judicial decisions often set precedents, guide state practice, and contribute to the overall evolution of international law."

  <p id="idLawInl017A7P1">7.1. In localities where the coastline is deeply indented and cut into, or if there is a fringe of islands along the coast in its immediate vicinity, the method of straight baselines joining appropriate points may be employed in drawing the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A7P1"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl017A7P2">7.2.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A7P2"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl017A7P3">7.3. The drawing of straight baselines must not depart to any appreciable extent from the general direction of the coast, and the sea areas lying within the lines must be sufficiently closely linked to the land domain to be subject to the regime of internal waters.

An indentation shall not, however, be regarded as a bay unless its area is as large as, or larger than, that of the semi-circle whose diameter is a line drawn across the mouth of that indentation.

For the purpose of measurement, the area of an indentation is that lying between the low-water mark around the shore of the indentation and a line joining the low-water mark of its natural entrance points.  Where, because of the presence of islands, an indentation has more than one mouth, the semi-circle shall be drawn on a line as long as the sum total of the lengths of the lines across the different mouths.  Islands within an indentation shall be included as if they were part of the water area of the indentation.

  <h5 id="idLawInl017A70H5">Article 70: Right of geographically disadvantaged States
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A70H5"></a></h5>
  <p id="idLawInl017A70P1">70.1. Geographically disadvantaged States shall have the right to participate, on an equitable basis, in the exploitation of an appropriate part of the surplus of the living resources of the exclusive economic zones of coastal States of the same subregion or region, taking into account the relevant economic and geographical circumstances of all the States concerned and in conformity with the provisions of this article and of articles 61 and 62.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A70P1"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl017A70P2">70.2. For the purposes of this Part, "geographically disadvantaged States" means coastal States, including States bordering enclosed or semi-enclosed seas, whose geographical situation makes them dependent upon the exploitation of the living resources of the exclusive economic zones of other States in the subregion or region for adequate supplies of fish for the nutritional purposes of their populations or parts thereof, and coastal States which can claim no exclusive economic zones of their own.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A70P2"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl017A70P3">70.3. The terms and modalities of such participation shall be established by the States concerned through bilateral, subregional or regional agreements taking into account, <i>inter alia</i>:
    <br>
    <br>(a) the need to avoid effects detrimental to fishing communities or fishing industries of the coastal State;
    <br>
    <br>(b) the extent to which the geographically disadvantaged State, in accordance with the provisions of this article, is participating or is entitled to participate under existing bilateral, subregional or regional agreements in the exploitation of living resources of the exclusive economic zones of other coastal States;
    <br>
    <br>(c) the extent to which other geographically disadvantaged States and land-locked States are participating in the exploitation of the living resources of the exclusive economic zone of the coastal State and the consequent need to avoid a particular burden for any single coastal State or a part of it;
    <br>
    <br>(d) the nutritional needs of the populations of the respective States.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A70P3"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl017A70P4">70.4. When the harvesting capacity of a coastal State approaches a point which would enable it to harvest the entire allowable catch of the living resources in its exclusive economic zone, the coastal State and other States concerned shall cooperate in the establishment of equitable arrangements on a bilateral, subregional or regional basis to allow for participation of developing geographically disadvantaged States of the same subregion or region in the exploitation of the living resources of the exclusive economic zones of coastal States of the subregion or region, as may be appropriate in the circumstances and on terms satisfactory to all parties.  In the implementation of this provision the factors mentioned in paragraph 3 shall also be taken into account.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A70P4"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl017A70P5">70.5. Developed geographically disadvantaged States shall, under the provisions of this article, be entitled to participate in the exploitation of living resources only in the exclusive economic zones of developed coastal States of the same subregion or region having regard to the extent to which the coastal State, in giving access to other States to the living resources of its exclusive economic zone, has taken into account the need to minimize detrimental effects on fishing communities and economic dislocation in States whose nationals have habitually fished in the zone.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A70P5"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl017A70P6">70.6. The above provisions are without prejudice to arrangements agreed upon in subregions or regions where the coastal States may grant to geographically disadvantaged States of the same subregion or region equal or preferential rights for the exploitation of the living resources in the exclusive economic zones.

Except where acts of interference derive from powers conferred by treaty, a warship which encounters on the high seas a foreign ship, other than a ship entitled to complete immunity in accordance with articles 95 and 96, is not justified in boarding it unless there is reasonable ground for suspecting that:
    <br>
    <br>(a) the ship is engaged in piracy;

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A111H5"></a></h5>
  <p id="idLawInl017A111P1">111.1. The hot pursuit of a foreign ship may be undertaken when the competent authorities of the coastal State have good reason to believe that the ship has violated the laws and regulations of that State.  Such pursuit must be commenced when the foreign ship or one of its boats is within the internal waters, the archipelagic waters, the territorial sea or the contiguous zone of the pursuing State, and may only be continued outside the territorial sea or the contiguous zone if the pursuit has not been interrupted.  It is not necessary that, at the time when the foreign ship within the territorial sea or the contiguous zone receives the order to stop, the ship giving the order should likewise be within the territorial sea or the contiguous zone.  If the foreign ship is within a contiguous zone, as defined in article 33, the pursuit may only be undertaken if there has been a violation of the rights for the protection of which the zone was established.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A111P1"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl017A111P2">111.2. The right of hot pursuit shall apply <i>mutatis mutandis</i> to violations in the exclusive economic zone or on the continental shelf, including safety zones around continental shelf installations, of the laws and regulations of the coastal State applicable in accordance with this Convention to the exclusive economic zone or the continental shelf, including such safety zones.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A111P2"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl017A111P3">111.3. The right of hot pursuit ceases as soon as the ship pursued enters the territorial sea of its own State or of a third State.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A111P3"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl017A111P4">111.4. Hot pursuit is not deemed to have begun unless the pursuing ship has satisfied itself by such practicable means as may be available that the ship pursued or one of its boats or other craft working as a team and using the ship pursued as a mother ship is within the limits of the territorial sea, or, as the case may be, within the contiguous zone or the exclusive economic zone or above the continental shelf.  The pursuit may only be commenced after a visual or auditory signal to stop has been given at a distance which enables it to be seen or heard by the foreign ship.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A111P4"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl017A111P5">111.5. The right of hot pursuit may be exercised only by warships or military aircraft, or other ships or aircraft clearly marked and identifiable as being on government service and authorized to that effect.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A111P5"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl017A111P6">111.6. Where hot pursuit is effected by an aircraft:
    <br>
    <br>(a) the provisions of paragraphs 1 to 4 shall apply<i> mutatis mutandis</i>;
    <br>
    <br>(b) the aircraft giving the order to stop must itself actively pursue the ship until a ship or another aircraft of the coastal State, summoned by the aircraft, arrives to take over the pursuit, unless the aircraft is itself able to arrest the ship.  It does not suffice to justify an arrest outside the territorial sea that the ship was merely sighted by the aircraft as an offender or suspected offender, if it was not both ordered to stop and pursued by the aircraft itself or other aircraft or ships which continue the pursuit without interruption.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A111P6"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl017A111P7">111.7. The release of a ship arrested within the jurisdiction of a State and escorted to a port of that State for the purposes of an inquiry before the competent authorities may not be claimed solely on the ground that the ship, in the course of its voyage, was escorted across a portion of the exclusive economic zone or the high seas, if the circumstances rendered this necessary.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A111P7"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl017A111P8">111.8. Where a ship has been stopped or arrested outside the territorial sea in circumstances which do not justify the exercise of the right of hot pursuit, it shall be compensated for any loss or damage that may have been thereby sustained.

    <br>(a) Without prejudice to the objectives set forth in article 150 and for the purpose of implementing subparagraph (h) of that article, the Authority, acting through existing forums or such new arrangements or agreements as may be appropriate, in which all interested parties, including both producers and consumers, participate, shall take measures necessary to promote the growth, efficiency and stability of markets for those commodities produced from the minerals derived from the Area, at prices remunerative to producers and fair to consumers.  All States Parties shall cooperate to this end.
    <br>
    <br>(b) The Authority shall have the right to participate in any commodity conference dealing with those commodities and in which all interested parties including both producers and consumers participate.  The Authority shall have the right to become a party to any arrangement or agreement resulting from such conferences.  Participation of the Authority in any organs established under those arrangements or agreements shall be in respect of production in the Area and in accordance with the relevant rules of those organs.
    <br>
    <br>(c) The Authority shall carry out its obligations under the arrangements or agreements referred to in this paragraph in a manner which assures a uniform and non-discriminatory implementation in respect of all production in the Area of the minerals concerned.  In doing so, the Authority shall act in a manner consistent with the terms of existing contracts and approved plans of work of the Enterprise.

  <p id="idLawInl017A151P2">151.2.
    <br>(a) During the interim period specified in paragraph 3, commercial production shall not be undertaken pursuant to an approved plan of work until the operator has applied for and has been issued a production authorization by the Authority.  Such production authorizations may not be applied for or issued more than five years prior to the planned commencement of commercial production under the plan of work unless, having regard to the nature and timing of project development, the rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority prescribe another period.
    <br>
    <br>(b) In the application for the production authorization, the operator shall specify the annual quantity of nickel expected to be recovered under the approved plan of work.  The application shall include a schedule of expenditures to be made by the operator after he has received the authorization which are reasonably calculated to allow him to begin commercial production on the date planned.
    <br>
    <br>(c) For the purposes of subparagraphs (a) and (b), the Authority shall establish appropriate performance requirements in accordance with Annex III, article 17.
    <br>
    <br>(d) The Authority shall issue a production authorization for the level of production applied for unless the sum of that level and the levels already authorized exceeds the nickel production ceiling, as calculated pursuant to paragraph 4 in the year of issuance of the authorization, during any year of planned production falling within the interim period.
    <br>
    <br>(e) When issued, the production authorization and approved application shall become a part of the approved plan of work.
    <br>
    <br>(f) If the operator's application for a production authorization is denied pursuant to subparagraph (d), the operator may apply again to the Authority at any time.

  <p id="idLawInl017A151P3">151.3. The interim period shall begin five years prior to 1 January of the year in which the earliest commercial production is planned to commence under an approved plan of work.  If the earliest commercial production is delayed beyond the year originally planned, the beginning of the interim period and the production ceiling originally calculated shall be adjusted accordingly.  The interim period shall last 25 years or until the end of the Review Conference referred to in article 155 or until the day when such new arrangements or agreements as are referred to in paragraph 1 enter into force, whichever is earliest.  The Authority shall resume the power provided in this article for the remainder of the interim period if the said arrangements or agreements should lapse or become ineffective for any reason whatsoever.

    <br>(ii) sixty per cent of the difference between the trend line values for nickel consumption, as calculated pursuant to subparagraph (b), for the year for which the production authorization is being applied for and the year immediately prior to the year of the earliest commercial production.
    <br>
    <br>(b) For the purposes of subparagraph (a):
    <br>(i) trend line values used for computing the nickel production ceiling shall be those annual nickel consumption values on a trend line computed during the year in which a production authorization is issued.  The trend line shall be derived from a linear regression of the logarithms of actual nickel consumption for the most recent 15-year period for which such data are available, time being the independent variable.  This trend line shall be referred to as the original trend line;
    <br>(ii) if the annual rate of increase of the original trend line is less than 3 per cent, then the trend line used to determine the quantities referred to in subparagraph (a) shall instead be one passing through the original trend line at the value for the first year of the relevant 15-year period, and increasing at 3 per cent annually; provided however that the production ceiling established for any year of the interim period may not in any case exceed the difference between the original trend line value for that year and the original trend line value for the year immediately prior to the commencement of the interim period.

  <p id="idLawInl017A151P6">151.6.
    <br>(a) An operator may in any year produce less than or up to 8 per cent more than the level of annual production of minerals from polymetallic nodules specified in his production authorization, provided that the over-all amount of production shall not exceed that specified in the authorization.  Any excess over 8 per cent and up to 20 per cent in any year, or any excess in the first and subsequent years following two consecutive years in which excesses occur, shall be negotiated with the Authority, which may require the operator to obtain a supplementary production authorization to cover additional production.
    <br>
    <br>(b) Applications for such supplementary production authorizations shall be considered by the Authority only after all pending applications by operators who have not yet received production authorizations have been acted upon and due account has been taken of other likely applicants.  The Authority shall be guided by the principle of not exceeding the total production allowed under the production ceiling in any year of the interim period.  It shall not authorize the production under any plan of work of a quantity in excess of 46,500 metric tonnes of nickel per year.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A151P6"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl017A151P7">151.7. The levels of production of other metals such as copper, cobalt and manganese extracted from the polymetallic nodules that are recovered pursuant to a production authorization should not be higher than those which would have been produced had the operator produced the maximum level of nickel from those nodules pursuant to this article.  The Authority shall establish rules, regulations and procedures pursuant to Annex III, article 17, to implement this paragraph.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A151P7"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl017A151P8">151.8. Rights and obligations relating to unfair economic practices under relevant multilateral trade agreements shall apply to the exploration for and exploitation of minerals from the Area.  In the settlement of disputes arising under this provision, States Parties which are Parties to such multilateral trade agreements shall have recourse to the dispute settlement procedures of such agreements.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A151P8"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl017A151P9">151.9. The Authority shall have the power to limit the level of production of minerals from the Area, other than minerals from polymetallic nodules, under such conditions and applying such methods as may be appropriate by adopting regulations in accordance with article 161, paragraph 8.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A151P9"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl017A151P10">151.10. Upon the recommendation of the Council on the basis of advice from the Economic Planning Commission, the Assembly shall establish a system of compensation or take other measures of economic adjustment assistance including cooperation with specialized agencies and other international organizations to assist developing countries which suffer serious adverse effects on their export earnings or economies resulting from a reduction in the price of an affected mineral or in the volume of exports of that mineral, to the extent that such reduction is caused by activities in the Area.  The Authority on request shall initiate studies on the problems of those States which are likely to be most seriously affected with a view to minimizing their difficulties and assisting them in their economic adjustment.

  <p id="idLawInl017A211P1">211.1. States, acting through the competent international organization or general diplomatic conference, shall establish international rules and standards to prevent, reduce and control pollution of the marine environment from vessels and promote the adoption, in the same manner, wherever appropriate, of routeing systems designed to minimize the threat of accidents which might cause pollution of the marine environment, including the coastline, and pollution damage to the related interests of coastal States.  Such rules and standards shall, in the same manner, be re-examined from time to time as necessary.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A211P1"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl017A211P2">211.2. States shall adopt laws and regulations for the prevention, reduction and control of pollution of the marine environment from vessels flying their flag or of their registry.  Such laws and regulations shall at least have the same effect as that of generally accepted international rules and standards established through the competent international organization or general diplomatic conference.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A211P2"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl017A211P3">211.3. States which establish particular requirements for the prevention, reduction and control of pollution of the marine environment as a condition for the entry of foreign vessels into their ports or internal waters or for a call at their off-shore terminals shall give due publicity to such requirements and shall communicate them to the competent international organization.  Whenever such requirements are established in identical form by two or more coastal States in an endeavour to harmonize policy, the communication shall indicate which States are participating in such cooperative arrangements.  Every State shall require the master of a vessel flying its flag or of its registry, when navigating within the territorial sea of a State participating in such cooperative arrangements, to furnish, upon the request of that State, information as to whether it is proceeding to a State of the same region participating in such cooperative arrangements and, if so, to indicate whether it complies with the port entry requirements of that State.  This article is without prejudice to the continued exercise by a vessel of its right of innocent passage or to the application of article 25, paragraph 2.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl017A211P3"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl017A211P4">211.4. Coastal States may, in the exercise of their sovereignty within their territorial sea, adopt laws and regulations for the prevention, reduction and control of marine pollution from foreign vessels, including vessels exercising the right of innocent passage.  Such laws and regulations shall, in accordance with Part II, section 3, not hamper innocent passage of foreign vessels.

  <p id="idLawInl017A211P5">211.5. Coastal States, for the purpose of enforcement as provided for in section 6, may in respect of their exclusive economic zones adopt laws and regulations for the prevention, reduction and control of pollution from vessels conforming to and giving effect to generally accepted international rules and standards established through the competent international organization or general diplomatic conference.

  <p id="idLawInl017A211P6">211.6.
    <br>(a) Where the international rules and standards referred to in paragraph 1 are inadequate to meet special circumstances and coastal States have reasonable grounds for believing that a particular, clearly defined area of their respective exclusive economic zones is an area where the adoption of special mandatory measures for the prevention of pollution from vessels is required for recognized technical reasons in relation to its oceanographical and ecological conditions, as well as its utilization or the protection of its resources and the particular character of its traffic, the coastal States, after appropriate consultations through the competent international organization with any other States concerned, may, for that area, direct a communication to that organization, submitting scientific and technical evidence in support and information on necessary reception facilities.  Within 12 months after receiving such a communication, the organization shall determine whether the conditions in that area correspond to the requirements set out above.  If the organization so determines, the coastal States may, for that area, adopt laws and regulations for the prevention, reduction and control of pollution from vessels implementing such international rules and standards or navigational practices as are made applicable, through the organization, for special areas.  These laws and regulations shall not become applicable to foreign vessels until 15 months after the submission of the communication to the organization.
    <br>
    <br>(b) The coastal States shall publish the limits of any such particular, clearly defined area.
    <br>
    <br>(c) If the coastal States intend to adopt additional laws and regulations for the same area for the prevention, reduction and control of pollution from vessels, they shall, when submitting the aforesaid communication, at the same time notify the organization thereof.  Such additional laws and regulations may relate to discharges or navigational practices but shall not require foreign vessels to observe design, construction, manning or equipment standards other than generally accepted international rules and standards; they shall become applicable to foreign vessels 15 months after the submission of the communication to the organization, provided that the organization agrees within 12 months after the submission of the communication.

  <p id="idLawInl006dsn">description::
    <br>">Rome statute:
    <br>The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC Statute or the Statute) is the international treaty that established the International Criminal Court (ICC). It was adopted at a diplomatic conference in Rome, Italy on 17 July 1998 and it entered into force on 1 July 2002. As of November 2023, 124 states are party to the statute.
    <br>
    <br>**The Statute defines the ICC's jurisdiction, powers, and procedures.** It also establishes the crimes that the ICC can prosecute, which are the most serious crimes of international concern, namely:
    <br>* **Genocide:** The intentional killing of members of a national, ethnical, racial or religious group with the intent to destroy the group.
    <br>* **Crimes against humanity:** A wide range of inhumane acts committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population, such as murder, torture, rape, and enslavement.
    <br>* **War crimes:** Serious violations of international humanitarian law committed during armed conflict, such as the intentional killing of civilians, torture, and the use of prohibited weapons.
    <br>* **The crime of aggression:** The planning, preparation, initiation, or waging of war that is clearly illegal under international law.
    <br>
    <br>The Statute also gives the ICC the power to issue arrest warrants, indictments, and summonses. It also establishes the ICC's trial and appeals chambers, as well as the Office of the Prosecutor and the Registry.
    <br>
    <br>The Rome Statute is a landmark achievement in the fight against impunity for the most serious crimes of international concern. It has helped to establish a permanent and independent international court that can investigate and prosecute individuals for these crimes, regardless of their nationality or the place where the crimes were committed.
    <br>
    <br>Here are some of the key provisions of the Rome Statute:
    <br>* **The ICC is a court of last resort.** This means that it can only intervene if national courts are unwilling or unable to genuinely prosecute the most serious crimes of international concern.
    <br>* **The ICC is a complementary court.** This means that it does not replace national courts, but rather works alongside them.
    <br>* **The ICC is an independent court.** This means that it is not subject to the control of any state or group of states.
    <br>* **The ICC is a fair and impartial court.** This means that it guarantees the rights of both defendants and victims.
    <br>
    <br>The Rome Statute is a complex and comprehensive document. For more information, please see the following resources:

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A19H3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idLawInl006A19P1">19.1. The Court shall satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in any case brought before it. The Court may, on its own motion, determine the admissibility of a case in accordance with article 17.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A19P1"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl006A19P2">19.2. Challenges to the admissibility of a case on the grounds referred to in article 17 or challenges to the jurisdiction of the Court may be made by:
    <br>
    <br>(a) An accused or a person for whom a warrant of arrest or a summons to appear has been issued under article 58;
    <br>
    <br>(b) A State which has jurisdiction over a case, on the ground that it is investigating or prosecuting the case or has investigated or prosecuted; or
    <br>
    <br>(c) A State from which acceptance of jurisdiction is required under article 12.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A19P2"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl006A19P3">19.3. The Prosecutor may seek a ruling from the Court regarding a question of jurisdiction or admissibility. In proceedings with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility, those who have referred the situation under article 13, as well as victims, may also submit observations to the Court.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A19P3"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl006A19P4">19.4. The admissibility of a case or the jurisdiction of the Court may be challenged only once by any person or State referred to in paragraph 2. The challenge shall take place prior to or at the commencement of the trial. In exceptional circumstances, the Court may grant leave for a challenge to be brought more than once or at a time later than the commencement of the trial. Challenges to the admissibility of a case, at the commencement of a trial, or subsequently with the leave of the Court, may be based only on article 17, paragraph 1 (c).
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A19P4"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl006A19P5">19.5. A State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) and (c) shall make a challenge at the earliest opportunity.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A19P5"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl006A19P6">19.6. Prior to the confirmation of the charges, challenges to the admissibility of a case or challenges to the jurisdiction of the Court shall be referred to the Pre-Trial Chamber. After confirmation of the charges, they shall be referred to the Trial Chamber. Decisions with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility may be appealed to the Appeals Chamber in accordance with article 82.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A19P6"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl006A19P7">19.7. If a challenge is made by a State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) or (c), the Prosecutor shall suspend the investigation until such time as the Court makes a determination in accordance with article 17.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A19P7"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl006A19P8">19.8. Pending a ruling by the Court, the Prosecutor may seek authority from the Court:
    <br>
    <br>(a) To pursue necessary investigative steps of the kind referred to in article 18, paragraph 6;
    <br>
    <br>(b) To take a statement or testimony from a witness or complete the collection and examination of evidence which had begun prior to the making of the challenge; and
    <br>
    <br>(c) In cooperation with the relevant States, to prevent the absconding of persons in respect of whom the Prosecutor has already requested a warrant of arrest under article 58.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A19P8"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl006A19P9">19.9. The making of a challenge shall not affect the validity of any act performed by the Prosecutor or any order or warrant issued by the Court prior to the making of the challenge.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A19P9"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl006A19P10">19.10. If the Court has decided that a case is inadmissible under article 17, the Prosecutor may submit a request for a review of the decision when he or she is fully satisfied that new facts have arisen which negate the basis on which the case had previously been found inadmissible under article 17.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A19P10"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl006A19P11">19.11. If the Prosecutor, having regard to the matters referred to in article 17, defers an investigation, the Prosecutor may request that the relevant State make available to the Prosecutor information on the proceedings. That information shall, at the request of the State concerned, be confidential. If the Prosecutor thereafter decides to proceed with an investigation, he or she shall notify the State to which deferral of the proceedings has taken place.

  <p id="idLawInl006A31P1">31.1. In addition to other grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for in this Statute, a person shall not be criminally responsible if, at the time of that person's conduct:
    <br>
    <br>(a) The person suffers from a mental disease or defect that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate the unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform to the requirements of law;
    <br>
    <br>(b) The person is in a state of intoxication that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate the unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform to the requirements of law, unless the person has become voluntarily intoxicated under such circumstances that the person knew, or disregarded the risk, that, as a result of the intoxication, he or she was likely to engage in conduct constituting a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court;

The fact that the person was involved in a defensive operation conducted by forces shall not in itself constitute a ground for excluding criminal responsibility under this subparagraph;
    <br>
    <br>(d) The conduct which is alleged to constitute a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been caused by duress resulting from a threat of imminent death or of continuing or imminent serious bodily harm against that person or another person, and the person acts necessarily and reasonably to avoid this threat, provided that the person does not intend to cause a greater harm than the one sought to be avoided. Such a threat may either be:
    <br>(i) Made by other persons; or
    <br>(ii) Constituted by other circumstances beyond that person's control.

  <p id="idLawInl006A72P1">72.1. This article applies in any case where the disclosure of the information or documents of a State would, in the opinion of that State, prejudice its national security interests. Such cases include those falling within the scope of article 56, paragraphs 2 and 3, article 61, paragraph 3, article 64, paragraph 3, article 67, paragraph 2, article 68, paragraph 6, article 87, paragraph 6 and article 93, as well as cases arising at any other stage of the proceedings where such disclosure may be at issue.

  <p id="idLawInl006A72P2">72.2. This article shall also apply when a person who has been requested to give information or evidence has refused to do so or has referred the matter to the State on the ground that disclosure would prejudice the national security interests of a State and the State concerned confirms that it is of the opinion that disclosure would prejudice its national security interests.

  <p id="idLawInl006A72P3">72.3. Nothing in this article shall prejudice the requirements of confidentiality applicable under article 54, paragraph 3 (e) and (f), or the application of article 73.

  <p id="idLawInl006A72P5">72.5. If, in the opinion of a State, disclosure of information would prejudice its national security interests, all reasonable steps will be taken by the State, acting in conjunction with the Prosecutor, the defence or the Pre-Trial Chamber or Trial Chamber, as the case may be, to seek to resolve the matter by cooperative means. Such steps may include:
    <br>
    <br>(a) Modification or clarification of the request;
    <br>
    <br>(b) A determination by the Court regarding the relevance of the information or evidence sought, or a determination as to whether the evidence, though relevant, could be or has been obtained from a source other than the requested State;
    <br>
    <br>(c) Obtaining the information or evidence from a different source or in a different form; or
    <br>
    <br>(d) Agreement on conditions under which the assistance could be provided including, among other things, providing summaries or redactions, limitations on disclosure, use of <span class="clsU">in camera</span> or <span class="clsU">ex parte</span> proceedings, or other protective measures permissible under the Statute and the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A72P5"></a></p>

Once all reasonable steps have been taken to resolve the matter through cooperative means, and if the State considers that there are no means or conditions under which the information or documents could be provided or disclosed without prejudice to its national security interests, it shall so notify the Prosecutor or the Court of the specific reasons for its decision, unless a specific description of the reasons would itself necessarily result in such prejudice to the State's national security interests.

  <p id="idLawInl006A72P7">72.7. Thereafter, if the Court determines that the evidence is relevant and necessary for the establishment of the guilt or innocence of the accused, the Court may undertake the following actions:
    <br>
    <br>(a) Where disclosure of the information or document is sought pursuant to a request for cooperation under Part 9 or the circumstances described in paragraph 2, and the State has invoked the ground for refusal referred to in article 93, paragraph 4:
    <br>(i) The Court may, before making any conclusion referred to in subparagraph 7 (a) (ii), request further consultations for the purpose of considering the State's representations, which may include, as appropriate, hearings <span class="clsU">in camera</span> and <span class="clsU">ex parte</span>;
    <br>(ii) If the Court concludes that, by invoking the ground for refusal under article 93, paragraph 4, in the circumstances of the case, the requested State is not acting in accordance with its obligations under this Statute, the Court may refer the matter in accordance with article 87, paragraph 7, specifying the reasons for its conclusion; and
    <br>(iii) The Court may make such inference in the trial of the accused as to the existence or non-existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances; or
    <br>
    <br>(b) In all other circumstances:
    <br>(i) rder disclosure; or
    <br>(ii) To the extent it does not order disclosure, make such inference in the trial of the accused as to the existence or non-existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances.

  <p id="idLawInl006A83P1">83.1. For the purposes of proceedings under article 81 and this article, the Appeals Chamber shall have all the powers of the Trial Chamber.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A83P1"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl006A83P2">83.2. If the Appeals Chamber finds that the proceedings appealed from were unfair in a way that affected the reliability of the decision or sentence, or that the decision or sentence appealed from was materially affected by error of fact or law or procedural error, it may:
    <br>
    <br>(a) Reverse or amend the decision or sentence; or
    <br>
    <br>(b) Order a new trial before a different Trial Chamber.
    <br>
    <br>For these purposes, the Appeals Chamber may remand a factual issue to the original Trial Chamber for it to determine the issue and to report back accordingly, or may itself call evidence to determine the issue. When the decision or sentence has been appealed only by the person convicted, or the Prosecutor on that person's behalf, it cannot be amended to his or her detriment.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A83P2"></a></p>

    <br>
    <br>(a) New evidence has been discovered that:
    <br>(i) Was not available at the time of trial, and such unavailability was not wholly or partially attributable to the party making application; and
    <br>(ii) Is sufficiently important that had it been proved at trial it would have been likely to have resulted in a different verdict;
    <br>
    <br>(b) It has been newly discovered that decisive evidence, taken into account at trial and upon which the conviction depends, was false, forged or falsified;
    <br>
    <br>(c) One or more of the judges who participated in conviction or confirmation of the charges has committed, in that case, an act of serious misconduct or serious breach of duty of sufficient gravity to justify the removal of that judge or those judges from office under article 46.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idLawInl006A84P1"></a></p>
  <p id="idLawInl006A84P2">84.2. The Appeals Chamber shall reject the application if it considers it to be unfounded. If it determines that the application is meritorious, it may, as appropriate:
    <br>
    <br>(a) Reconvene the original Trial Chamber;
    <br>
    <br>(b) Constitute a new Trial Chamber; or
    <br>
    <br>(c) Retain jurisdiction over the matter, with a view to, after hearing the parties in the manner set forth in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, arriving at a determination on whether the judgement should be revised.

    <br>(a) A sentence of imprisonment shall be served in a State designated by the Court from a list of States which have indicated to the Court their willingness to accept sentenced persons.
    <br>

    <br>(a) The State of enforcement shall notify the Court of any circumstances, including the exercise of any conditions agreed under paragraph 1, which could materially affect the terms or extent of the imprisonment. The Court shall be given at least 45 days' notice of any such known or foreseeable circumstances. During this period, the State of enforcement shall take no action that might prejudice its obligations under article 110.
    <br>
    <br>(b) Where the Court cannot agree to the circumstances referred to in subparagraph (a), it shall notify the State of enforcement and proceed in accordance with article 104, paragraph 1.

  <p id="idLawInl006A103P4">103.4.

    <br>"Exercise is any bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness.[1]
    <br>It is performed for various reasons, to aid growth and improve strength, preventing aging, developing muscles and the cardiovascular system, honing athletic skills, weight loss or maintenance, improving health[2] and also for enjoyment. Many individuals choose to exercise outdoors where they can congregate in groups, socialize, and enhance well-being.[3]
    <br>In terms of health benefits, the amount of recommended exercise depends upon the goal, the type of exercise, and the age of the person. Even doing a small amount of exercise is healthier than doing none.[4]"

  <p id="idExcsDatt001dsn">description::
    <br>"VO₂ max is the maximum (max) rate (V) of oxygen (O₂) your body is able to use during exercise.
    <br>Oxygen is a critical ingredient in the respiratory process that’s involved in breathing. As you breathe in oxygen, your lungs absorb and turn it into energy called adenosine triphosphate (ATP)Trusted Source.
    <br>ATP powers your cells and helps release the carbon dioxide (CO₂) that’s created during your respiratory process when you exhale.
    <br>The benefits are simple: The greater your VO₂ max, the more oxygen your body can consume, and the more effectively your body can use that oxygen to generate the maximum amount of ATP energy.
    <br>The greater your VO₂ max, the more oxygen your body can consume, and the more effectively your body can use that oxygen to generate the maximum amount of ATP energy.
    <br>This means that your body can better handle aerobic fitness activities that require a lot of oxygen intake like running, swimming, and other types of cardio.
    <br>This also means that a high VO₂ max can be a good predictor of your athletic performance, especially if you’re a runner or a swimmer.
    <br>Your VO₂ max amount can also act as a benchmark to track your progress as you improve your athletic abilities or if you’re trying to keep your VO₂ max at a certain level to maintain your performance."

    <br>===
    <br>"There are many ways that exercise might reduce depression. Exercise may block negative thoughts, or distract people from daily worries. If a person exercises with others, exercise may increase social contact. Compared to people without depression, depressed people generally have lower fitness levels, and increased fitness may lift mood. Exercise may increase levels of neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) that have been found to be in short supply in depression. Exercise may also increase endorphins, which are chemicals in the brain that have 'mood-lifting' qualities.
    <br>A number of studies have found that exercise helps depression. Jogging, weightlifting, walking, stationary bicycling and resistance training (pushing or pulling weights with arms and legs) are all helpful. Exercise has been found to be more helpful for depression than relaxation therapy, health education and light therapy. In older people, exercise has been found to be as helpful as antidepressant medication or social contact. Unfortunately, the number of good studies in this area is small, and further work needs to be done. People can injure themselves doing exercise, and people over 35 years of age should seek a medical check up before starting strenuous exercise.
    <br>There is evidence that physical activity helps depression. However, further research is required to confirm its effectiveness in younger people.

    <br>"Aerobic exercise (also known as cardio) is physical exercise[1] of low to high intensity that depends primarily on the aerobic energy-generating process.[2] "Aerobic" means "relating to, involving, or requiring free oxygen",[3] and refers to the use of oxygen to adequately meet energy demands during exercise via aerobic metabolism.[4] Generally, light-to-moderate intensity activities that are sufficiently supported by aerobic metabolism can be performed for extended periods of time.[2] What is generally called aerobic exercise might be better termed "solely aerobic", because it is designed to be low-intensity enough so that all carbohydrates are aerobically turned into energy.
    <br>When practiced in this way, examples of cardiovascular or aerobic exercise are medium to long distance running or jogging, swimming, cycling, and walking."

    <br>"Sport pertains to any form of competitive physical activity or game[1] that aims to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants and, in some cases, entertainment to spectators.[2] Sports can, through casual or organized participation, improve one's physical health. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a match) is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs.
    <br>Sport is generally recognised as system of activities based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition.[3] Other organisations, such as the Council of Europe, preclude activities without a physical element from classification as sports.[2] However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess, draughts (checkers), Go and xiangqi,[4][5] and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.[1]
    <br>Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.
    <br>Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting. Sport betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.
    <br>According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013.[6] The world's most accessible and practised sport is running, while association football is the most popular spectator sport.[7]"

    <br>"Endurance training is the act of exercising to increase endurance. The term endurance training generally refers to training the aerobic system as opposed to the anaerobic system. The need for endurance in sports is often predicated as the need of cardiovascular and simple muscular endurance, but the issue of endurance is far more complex. Endurance can be divided into two categories including: general endurance and specific endurance. It can be shown that endurance in sport is closely tied to the execution of skill and technique. A well conditioned athlete can be defined as, the athlete who executes his or her technique consistently and effectively with the least effort.[1]"

    <br>"Jogging is a form of trotting or running at a slow or leisurely pace. The main intention is to increase physical fitness with less stress on the body than from faster running but more than walking, or to maintain a steady speed for longer periods of time. Performed over long distances, it is a form of aerobic endurance training."

    <br>"Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball validly will not gain a point, while the opposite player will."

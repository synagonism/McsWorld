    <br>"A physician (American English), medical practitioner (Commonwealth English), medical doctor, or simply doctor, is a professional who practices medicine, which is concerned with promoting, maintaining or restoring health through the study, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of disease, injury, and other physical and mental impairments. Physicians may focus their practice on certain disease categories, types of patients, and methods of treatment—known as specialities—or they may assume responsibility for the provision of continuing and comprehensive medical care to individuals, families, and communities—known as general practice.[2] Medical practice properly requires both a detailed knowledge of the academic disciplines, such as anatomy and physiology, underlying diseases and their treatment—the science of medicine—and also a decent competence in its applied practice—the art or craft of medicine.
    <br>Both the role of the physician and the meaning of the word itself vary around the world. Degrees and other qualifications vary widely, but there are some common elements, such as medical ethics requiring that physicians show consideration, compassion, and benevolence for their patients."

    <br>"The terms medical record, health record, and medical chart are used somewhat interchangeably to describe the systematic documentation of a single patient's medical history and care across time within one particular health care provider's jurisdiction.[1] The medical record includes a variety of types of "notes" entered over time by health care professionals, recording observations and administration of drugs and therapies, orders for the administration of drugs and therapies, test results, x-rays, reports, etc. The maintenance of complete and accurate medical records is a requirement of health care providers and is generally enforced as a licensing or certification prerequisite.
    <br>The terms are used for the written (paper notes), physical (image films) and digital records that exist for each individual patient and for the body of information found therein.
    <br>Medical records have traditionally been compiled and maintained by health care providers, but advances in online data storage have led to the development of personal health records (PHR) that are maintained by patients themselves, often on third-party websites.[2] This concept is supported by US national health administration entities[3] and by AHIMA, the American Health Information Management Association.[4]
    <br>In 2009, Congress authorized and funded legislation known as the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act [5] to stimulate the conversion of paper medical records into electronic charts. While many hospitals and doctor's offices have since done this successfully, electronic health vendors' proprietary systems haven't always been compatible with one another, and an untold number of patients undergo duplicate procedures — or fail to get them at all — because key pieces of their medical history are missing.[6]
    <br>Because many consider the information in medical records to be sensitive private information covered by expectations of privacy, many ethical and legal issues are implicated in their maintenance, such as third-party access and appropriate storage and disposal.[7] Although the storage equipment for medical records generally is the property of the health care provider, the actual record is considered in most jurisdictions to be the property of the patient, who may obtain copies upon request."

    <br>"In biology, poisons are substances that cause death, injury or harm to organs, usually by chemical reactions or other activity on the molecular scales, when an organism absorbs a sufficient quantity.[1][2]
    <br>The fields of medicine (particularly veterinary) and zoology often distinguish a poison from a toxin, and from a venom. Toxins are poisons produced by organisms in nature, and venoms are toxins injected by a bite or sting (this is exclusive to animals). The difference between venom and other poisons is the delivery method"

    <br>"A toxin is a poisonous substance produced within living cells or organisms;[1][2] synthetic toxicants created by artificial processes are thus excluded. The term was first used by organic chemist Ludwig Brieger (1849–1919),[3] derived from the word toxic.[4]
    <br>Toxins can be small molecules, peptides, or proteins that are capable of causing disease on contact with or absorption by body tissues interacting with biological macromolecules such as enzymes or cellular receptors. Toxins vary greatly in their toxicity, ranging from usually minor (such as a bee sting) to almost immediately deadly (such as botulinum toxin)."

    <br>"Venom is a secretion containing one or more toxins produced by an animal.[1] Venom has evolved in a wide variety of animals, both predators and prey, and both vertebrates and invertebrates.
    <br>Venoms kill through the action of at least four major classes of toxin, namely necrotoxins and cytotoxins, which kill cells; neurotoxins, which affect nervous systems; and myotoxins, which damage muscles. Biologically, venom is distinguished from poison in that poisons are ingested, while venom is delivered in a bite, sting, or similar action. Venomous animals cause tens of thousands of human deaths per year. However, the toxins in many venoms have potential to treat a wide range of diseases."

    <br>"Dangerous goods, abbreviated DG, are substances that when transported are a risk to health, safety, property or the environment. Certain dangerous goods that pose risks even when not being transported are known as hazardous materials (abbreviated as HAZMAT or hazmat).
    <br>Hazardous materials are often subject to chemical regulations. Hazmat teams are personnel specially trained to handle dangerous goods, which include materials that are radioactive, flammable, explosive, corrosive, oxidizing, asphyxiating, biohazardous, toxic, pathogenic, or allergenic. Also included are physical conditions such as compressed gases and liquids or hot materials, including all goods containing such materials or chemicals, or may have other characteristics that render them hazardous in specific circumstances.
    <br>In the United States, dangerous goods are often indicated by diamond-shaped signage on the item (see NFPA 704), its container, or the building where it is stored. The color of each diamond indicates its hazard, e.g., flammable is indicated with red, because fire and heat are generally of red color, and explosive is indicated with orange, because mixing red (flammable) with yellow (oxidizing agent) creates orange. A nonflammable and nontoxic gas is indicated with green, because all compressed air vessels are this color in France after World War II, and France was where the diamond system of hazmat identification originated."

    <br>"Health organizations are entities focused on promoting and protecting public health. They operate at various levels, from international to local, and play a crucial role in disease prevention, health education, and policy-making. Here's an overview of different types of health organizations:
    <br>
    <br>### 1. **International Health Organizations**
    <br>   - **World Health Organization (WHO):** The WHO is a specialized agency of the United Nations, established in 1948. It is the leading global health authority, responsible for setting international health standards, coordinating responses to health emergencies, and providing guidance on public health issues. The WHO works with member states to address global health challenges like pandemics, chronic diseases, and vaccine distribution.
    <br>### 2. **National Health Organizations**
    <br>   - **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) - United States:** The CDC is a U.S. federal agency under the Department of Health and Human Services. It focuses on disease prevention, health promotion, and preparedness for new health threats. The CDC is also involved in research, policy development, and public health education.
    <br>   - **National Health Service (NHS) - United Kingdom:** The NHS is the publicly funded healthcare system in the UK, providing comprehensive healthcare services to all residents. It is one of the largest single-payer health systems in the world and is responsible for ensuring that healthcare is accessible and affordable.
    <br>### 3. **Regional Health Organizations**
    <br>   - **Pan American Health Organization (PAHO):** PAHO is an international public health agency working within the Americas. It serves as the regional office for the WHO in the Americas and focuses on improving the health and quality of life of the people in the region.
    <br>   - **European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC):** The ECDC is an agency of the European Union tasked with strengthening Europe's defenses against infectious diseases. It provides guidance and support to EU member states in preventing and controlling outbreaks.
    <br>### 4. **Non-Governmental Health Organizations (NGOs)**
    <br>   - **Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières):** An international humanitarian organization that provides medical care in conflict zones, natural disaster areas, and regions with endemic diseases. It operates independently of governments and focuses on delivering medical aid to those in need, regardless of political affiliations.
    <br>   - **The Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies:** These organizations provide emergency assistance, disaster relief, and education in communities around the world. They also play a vital role in blood donation and distribution, health education, and refugee assistance.
    <br>### 5. **Local Health Organizations**
    <br>   - **County and City Health Departments:** In many countries, local health departments are responsible for implementing health policies, conducting community health assessments, and providing direct services such as immunizations, health screenings, and education.
    <br>### 6. **Private Health Organizations**
    <br>   - **Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs):** These are private organizations that provide or arrange managed care for health insurance, self-funded healthcare benefit plans, individuals, and other entities in the U.S. They focus on providing preventive care and often operate on a capitation model.
    <br>
    <br>### Key Functions of Health Organizations:
    <br>   - **Disease Prevention and Control:** Monitoring and controlling the spread of diseases, especially infectious diseases.
    <br>   - **Health Promotion:** Educating the public about healthy behaviors and lifestyles to prevent illness.
    <br>   - **Health Policy Development:** Advising governments and organizations on health policies and regulations.
    <br>   - **Research:** Conducting and supporting research on health issues to improve treatment, prevention, and healthcare delivery.
    <br>   - **Emergency Response:** Coordinating responses to health emergencies such as pandemics, natural disasters, and outbreaks.
    <br>
    <br>### Current Challenges:
    <br>   - **Pandemics and Emerging Infectious Diseases:** The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of global cooperation and preparedness in addressing health crises.
    <br>   - **Chronic Diseases:** Managing the rise of chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.
    <br>   - **Health Equity:** Addressing disparities in healthcare access and outcomes among different populations.
    <br>These organizations are essential in maintaining and improving public health at all levels, from global initiatives to local interventions."

    <br>"Hospital beds are specialized beds used in healthcare settings to support patients during their stay. They are designed to accommodate various medical needs and improve patient comfort, safety, and care efficiency.
    <br>
    <br>### Key Features of Hospital Beds:
    <br>1. **Adjustability**: Hospital beds can be adjusted in multiple ways, such as raising or lowering the head, foot, or entire bed to assist with patient positioning, reduce pressure ulcers, and aid in medical procedures.
    <br>2. **Safety Rails**: Most hospital beds are equipped with side rails that can be raised or lowered to prevent falls, provide support when moving in bed, and serve as attachment points for various medical devices.
    <br>3. **Mobility**: Hospital beds often have wheels, allowing for easy movement within the healthcare facility. The wheels can be locked to keep the bed stationary.
    <br>4. **Built-in Technology**: Modern hospital beds may include integrated controls for the bed's adjustments, vital sign monitoring, patient alarms, and communication systems. Some beds are equipped with sensors that detect patient movement or alert staff if the patient attempts to leave the bed unsafely.
    <br>5. **Mattress Compatibility**: Hospital beds are designed to accommodate various types of mattresses, including those that help prevent pressure sores or provide additional support.
    <br>
    <br>### Types of Hospital Beds:
    <br>1. **Manual Beds**: Operated by hand cranks, these are typically used in settings with limited resources.
    <br>2. **Semi-electric Beds**: These beds have motorized head and foot adjustments, but the height adjustment is done manually.
    <br>3. **Electric Beds**: Fully motorized, allowing for easy adjustment of the bed's position and height with minimal effort.
    <br>4. **Specialty Beds**: Designed for specific medical conditions, such as bariatric beds for heavier patients or low beds to reduce fall risk.
    <br>
    <br>### Applications:
    <br>- **Acute Care**: Used in hospitals for patients requiring intensive care or post-surgical recovery.
    <br>- **Long-term Care**: Found in nursing homes or rehabilitation centers, where patients may require extended care.
    <br>- **Home Care**: Some hospital beds are designed for use in home settings, providing patients with a comfortable and adjustable bed while recovering from illness or surgery.
    <br>These beds are an essential component of patient care, helping to improve recovery outcomes and ensuring the safety and comfort of patients."

    <br>"healthcare system definition
    <br>A healthcare system refers to the organized network of individuals, institutions, resources, and policies that work collectively to provide medical services, promote health, and manage various aspects of healthcare delivery within a specific geographic area or country. It encompasses a wide range of activities, including medical treatment, preventive measures, diagnostics, rehabilitation, and health promotion, all aimed at maintaining and improving the overall health and well-being of individuals and communities.
    <br>Key components of a healthcare system include:
    <br>* Healthcare Providers: These are the individuals and organizations that deliver medical care, including doctors, nurses, specialists, hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, and other medical facilities.
    <br>* Healthcare Services: These encompass a variety of medical interventions, from primary care and routine check-ups to specialized treatments, surgeries, emergency care, and chronic disease management.
    <br>* Healthcare Financing: This involves the mechanisms by which healthcare services are funded. It includes sources of funding such as government funding, private health insurance, out-of-pocket payments by individuals, and philanthropic contributions.
    <br>* Healthcare Regulation and Policy: Governments and regulatory bodies establish laws, regulations, and policies that guide the operation of the healthcare system, ensuring quality, safety, ethical standards, and access to care.
    <br>* Health Information Systems: These systems manage medical records, patient data, health information exchange, and electronic health records, which are crucial for effective patient care, research, and public health planning.
    <br>* Healthcare Workforce: The skilled professionals, including doctors, nurses, allied health workers, technicians, and administrative staff, who provide and support healthcare services.
    <br>* Public Health Initiatives: These focus on population-level health, disease prevention, health education, and promotion. They address issues such as vaccinations, disease outbreaks, health campaigns, and environmental health.
    <br>* Medical Research and Innovation: Healthcare systems often contribute to medical research, drug development, and technological advancements to improve diagnosis, treatment, and overall healthcare outcomes.
    <br>* Healthcare Access and Equity: Ensuring that all individuals have access to quality healthcare services, regardless of their socio-economic status, location, or other factors, is a critical aspect of any healthcare system.
    <br>* Healthcare Outcomes: Measuring the impact of healthcare interventions on the health status of individuals and communities, including metrics like mortality rates, disease prevalence, life expectancy, and quality of life.
    <br>Healthcare systems can vary significantly from one country to another due to cultural, economic, political, and social factors. Some countries have publicly funded universal healthcare systems, while others rely more on private health insurance and market-driven approaches. The effectiveness of a healthcare system is often evaluated based on its ability to provide timely, safe, effective, and equitable care to its population."

    <br>· sector + relations = system.
    <br>
    <br>">healthcare system vs healthcare sector:
    <br>The terms "healthcare system" and "healthcare sector" are often used in discussions about health services, but they refer to different concepts within the broader field of healthcare. Here's a breakdown of each term:
    <br>1. **Healthcare System**:
    <br>   - This term refers to the organization and delivery mechanisms of health services within a particular country or community. It encompasses all the institutions, resources, and people involved in providing healthcare services to populations.
    <br>   - The healthcare system includes various components such as hospitals, clinics, healthcare providers (doctors, nurses, specialists), health insurance companies, and the policies and regulations that govern the provision of health services.
    <br>   - The primary focus of a healthcare system is on the structure, efficiency, accessibility, and quality of health services offered to the public. It is concerned with how these services are delivered, funded, and consumed.
    <br>2. **Healthcare Sector**:
    <br>   - This term generally refers to the economic or business side of healthcare. It includes all aspects of the industry that provide goods and services to treat patients with curative, preventive, rehabilitative, and palliative care.
    <br>   - The healthcare sector covers a broader range of elements, including pharmaceutical companies, medical equipment manufacturers, healthcare facilities (like hospitals and nursing homes), and medical insurance companies.
    <br>   - The sector is part of the larger economic system and is analyzed for its impact on employment, investment, and economic growth. It encompasses public, private, and voluntary entities that contribute to the production and distribution of healthcare services.
    <br>In summary, the "healthcare system" is more about the organizational and operational aspects of health service delivery within a community or country, focusing on public health and service efficiency. The "healthcare sector," however, represents the broader economic and business activities related to healthcare, including all industries and services that contribute to healthcare economics."

    <br>"Health insurance is a contract that provides financial protection against medical expenses. It can cover costs such as doctor's visits, hospital stays, medications, and surgeries. There are various types of health insurance plans available, each with different levels of coverage and benefits.
    <br>Here are some of the main types of health insurance plans:
    <br>* **HMO (Health Maintenance Organization):** This type of plan typically requires you to choose a primary care physician (PCP) who coordinates all your healthcare needs. You'll need a referral from your PCP to see a specialist.
    <br>* **PPO (Preferred Provider Organization):** This plan allows you to see any doctor or specialist within the network without a referral. You can also see out-of-network providers, but you'll usually pay more out of pocket.
    <br>* **POS (Point of Service):** This plan is a hybrid of HMO and PPO plans. You choose a PCP, but you can also see out-of-network providers with a referral.
    <br>* **EPO (Exclusive Provider Organization):** This plan only covers care from doctors and hospitals within the network. There is no coverage for out-of-network care except in emergencies.
    <br>* **High-Deductible Health Plan (HDHP):** This plan has a high deductible, but it also has lower monthly premiums. It's often paired with a Health Savings Account (HSA), which allows you to save money tax-free for medical expenses.
    <br>Choosing the right health insurance plan depends on your individual needs and budget. Consider factors such as the monthly premium, deductible, co-payments, and the network of providers.
    <br>Here are some additional resources that may be helpful:

  <p id="idHlthHmnatt007AggUnvldsn">description::
    <br>"Universal health insurance is a system in which every individual within a particular country or region is covered by health insurance, ensuring access to healthcare services without the burden of substantial out-of-pocket expenses. This model aims to provide comprehensive healthcare coverage for all citizens, regardless of their income, employment status, or health condition.
    <br>
    <br>### Key Features of Universal Health Insurance:
    <br>1. **Coverage for All**: Every citizen or legal resident is automatically covered by health insurance, ensuring that no one is left without access to necessary medical services.
    <br>2. **Government Involvement**: The government typically plays a significant role in organizing and financing the health insurance system. This may involve collecting taxes to fund the system and regulating private insurers if they are part of the system.
    <br>3. **Basic Health Services**: Universal health insurance usually covers a standard package of healthcare services, which may include primary care, hospitalization, prescription drugs, and preventive services.
    <br>4. **Equity in Access**: One of the primary goals is to ensure that everyone has equal access to healthcare services, regardless of their socio-economic status.
    <br>5. **Cost Control**: By centralizing the insurance system, governments can often negotiate lower prices for services and medications, helping to control overall healthcare costs.
    <br>
    <br>### Examples of Universal Health Insurance Systems:
    <br>- **National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom**: Funded by taxes, the NHS provides healthcare services that are free at the point of use for all UK residents.
    <br>- **Medicare in Australia**: Funded through taxes and the Medicare levy, this system provides free or subsidized access to a range of healthcare services for Australian citizens and permanent residents.
    <br>- **Canada's Health Insurance System**: Funded primarily through taxes, Canada's system provides universal coverage for all necessary hospital and physician services.
    <br>
    <br>### Benefits of Universal Health Insurance:
    <br>- **Improved Public Health**: With everyone having access to healthcare, preventive services, and early treatments, overall public health tends to improve.
    <br>- **Reduced Financial Hardship**: Universal coverage protects individuals from the financial risks associated with high medical costs.
    <br>- **Social Equity**: It helps to reduce disparities in health outcomes across different segments of the population.
    <br>
    <br>### Challenges:
    <br>- **Funding**: Implementing and maintaining universal health insurance requires significant public funding, often through higher taxes or reallocating government budgets.
    <br>- **Efficiency**: Ensuring that the system runs efficiently without long wait times or unnecessary bureaucracy can be challenging.
    <br>- **Scope of Coverage**: Deciding which services and medications are covered and how to manage cost without compromising quality of care is a critical issue.
    <br>Universal health insurance remains a topic of significant debate, especially in countries that do not currently have such a system, with discussions focusing on how to balance coverage, cost, and quality of care."

  <h1 id="idHlthHmnatt010H1">right-to-health of health
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idHlthHmnatt010H1"></a></h1>
  <p id="idHlthHmnatt010dsn">description::
    <br>"The right to health is a fundamental human right that encompasses access to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. It is recognized in various international human rights instruments, most notably in Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR, 1966).
    <br>
    <br>### Key Components of the Right to Health:
    <br>1. **Availability**: Health facilities, goods, services, and programs must be available in sufficient quantity within a country.
    <br>2. **Accessibility**: Health services must be accessible to everyone without discrimination. Accessibility has four overlapping dimensions:
    <br>   - **Non-discrimination**: Health services must be accessible to all, particularly the most vulnerable or marginalized populations.
    <br>   - **Physical Accessibility**: Health facilities must be within safe physical reach for all sections of the population, especially vulnerable or marginalized groups.
    <br>   - **Economic Accessibility (Affordability)**: Health services must be affordable for all. Payment for health-care services should be based on the principle of equity, ensuring that these services are accessible to all, including socially disadvantaged groups.
    <br>   - **Information Accessibility**: Information about health issues must be accessible, which includes the right to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas concerning health issues.
    <br>3. **Acceptability**: Health services must be respectful of medical ethics, culturally appropriate, and sensitive to gender and life-cycle requirements.
    <br>4. **Quality**: Health facilities, goods, and services must be scientifically and medically appropriate and of good quality.
    <br>
    <br>### Legal Recognition:
    <br>- **International Treaties**: The right to health is enshrined in various international treaties. For example, Article 12 of the ICESCR requires countries to recognize the right of everyone to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.
    <br>- **National Constitutions and Laws**: Many countries have incorporated the right to health into their national constitutions and laws, providing a legal framework for the implementation of this right at the national level.
    <br>
    <br>### State Obligations:
    <br>States have three levels of obligations under the right to health:
    <br>- **Respect**: This requires the state to refrain from interfering with the enjoyment of the right to health.
    <br>- **Protect**: This requires the state to prevent third parties from interfering with the right to health.
    <br>- **Fulfill**: This requires the state to adopt appropriate legislative, administrative, budgetary, judicial, and other measures toward the full realization of the right to health.
    <br>
    <br>### Challenges and Issues:
    <br>Despite the recognition of the right to health, many challenges exist, including inequality in access to healthcare, inadequate health infrastructure, discrimination in healthcare settings, and insufficient governmental commitment. Global health issues such as pandemics, health financing, and the impact of climate change also pose significant challenges to the realization of the right to health.
    <br>
    <br>### Conclusion:
    <br>The right to health is a comprehensive and inclusive right that is vital for the dignity of every human being. Its realization requires a multifaceted approach, addressing social determinants of health, ensuring non-discrimination, and implementing robust healthcare systems that are accessible, affordable, acceptable, and of high quality."

    <br>
    <br>### Global Trends and Challenges:
    <br>- **Variation in Spending**: There is significant variation in public health spending between countries, often correlated with economic status. High-income countries generally spend a larger percentage of their GDP on health compared to low-income countries.
    <br>- **Sustainability Concerns**: Rising healthcare costs, driven by factors such as aging populations and the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, pose challenges for sustaining public health spending.
    <br>- **Efficiency and Effectiveness**: There is an ongoing debate about how to ensure that public spending on health is efficient and effectively meets the needs of the population.
    <br>
    <br>In summary, public spending on health is a critical aspect of government policy that directly affects the well-being of a nation's population. Effective and efficient public health spending can lead to better health outcomes, reduced inequalities in healthcare access, and overall economic benefits."

    <br>"Mental health is the level of psychological well-being or an absence of mental illness. It is the state of someone who is "functioning at a satisfactory level of emotional and behavioral adjustment".[1] From the perspectives of positive psychology or of holism, mental health may include an individual's ability to enjoy life and to create a balance between life activities and efforts to achieve psychological resilience.[2] According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mental health includes "subjective well-being, perceived self-efficacy, autonomy, competence, inter-generational dependence, and self-actualization of one's intellectual and emotional potential, among others".[3] The WHO further states that the well-being of an individual is encompassed in the realization of their abilities, coping with normal stresses of life, productive work, and contribution to their community.[4] Cultural differences, subjective assessments, and competing professional theories all affect how one defines "mental health".[3][5]"

    <br>"Social isolation, regardless of feelings of loneliness, may have negative health consequences and even shorten lives.
    <br>Social isolation -- a lack of companionship or interaction -- might correlate with a higher rate of illness and mortality, according to a study that followed participants age 52 or older from 2004-2012.
    <br>Even if the respondents did not necessarily feel lonely, researchers found that the most socially isolated participants had a 26% higher mortality rate.
    <br>These findings led researchers to think that having confidants could result in symptoms of illness or poor health being noticed sooner.
    <br>In addition, physical contact correlated with a decrease in health symptoms such as pain or high blood pressure.

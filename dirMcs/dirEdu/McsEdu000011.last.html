    <br>"Art is a diverse range of human activity, and resulting product, that involves creative or imaginative talent expressive of technical proficiency, beauty, emotional power, or conceptual ideas.[1][2][3]
    <br>There is no generally agreed definition of what constitutes art,[4][5][6] and its interpretation has varied greatly throughout history and across cultures. In the Western tradition, the three classical branches of visual art are painting, sculpture, and architecture.[7] Theatre, dance, and other performing arts, as well as literature, music, film and other media such as interactive media, are included in a broader definition of the arts.[1][8] Until the 17th century, art referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or sciences. In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the decorative or applied arts.
    <br>The nature of art and related concepts, such as creativity and interpretation, are explored in a branch of philosophy known as aesthetics.[9] The resulting artworks are studied in the professional fields of art criticism and the history of art."

  <p id="idArtworkdsn">description::
    <br>"A work of art, artwork,[1] art piece, piece of art or art object is an artistic creation of aesthetic value. Except for "work of art", which may be used of any work regarded as art in its widest sense, including works from literature and music, these terms apply principally to tangible, physical forms of visual art:
    <br>* An example of fine art, such as a painting or sculpture.
    <br>* Objects in the decorative arts or applied arts that have been designed for aesthetic appeal, as well as any functional purpose, such as a piece of jewellery, many ceramics and much folk art.
    <br>* An object created for principally or entirely functional, religious or other non-aesthetic reasons which has come to be appreciated as art (often later, or by cultural outsiders).
    <br>* A non-ephemeral photograph or film.
    <br>* A work of installation art or conceptual art.
    <br>Used more broadly, the term is less commonly applied to:
    <br>* A fine work of architecture or landscape design
    <br>* A production of live performance, such as theater, ballet, opera, performance art, musical concert and other performing arts, and other ephemeral, non-tangible creations.
    <br>This article is concerned with the terms and concepts as used in and applied to the visual arts, although other fields such as aural-music and written word-literature have similar issues and philosophies. The term objet d'art is reserved to describe works of art that are not paintings, prints, drawings or large or medium-sized sculptures, or architecture (e.g. household goods, figurines, etc., some purely aesthetic, some also practical). The term oeuvre is used to describe the complete body of work completed by an artist throughout a career.[2]"

    <br>">art vs entertainment:
    <br>While the terms "arts" and "entertainment" are related, they refer to distinct concepts that serve different purposes and often have different characteristics. Here's a breakdown of the key differences between arts and entertainment:
    <br>
    <br>**Arts:**
    <br>1. **Purpose:** The primary purpose of the arts is often self-expression, communication, and the exploration of ideas and emotions. Artists may create works to provoke thought, convey a message, or reflect on the human experience.
    <br>2. **Focus on Creativity:** The arts emphasize creativity, originality, and the development of unique perspectives. Artists may challenge conventional norms and push boundaries in their creative endeavors.
    <br>3. **Subjectivity:** Art is often subjective, and interpretations can vary widely among individuals. Different people may derive different meanings or experiences from the same work of art.
    <br>4. **Diverse Forms:** The arts encompass a wide range of forms, including visual arts (painting, sculpture), performing arts (dance, theater, music), literary arts (literature, poetry), and more. Each form has its own conventions and methods of expression.
    <br>5. **Cultural and Historical Significance:** Art has often played a crucial role in reflecting and shaping cultures throughout history. It can be a means of preserving cultural heritage and conveying societal values.
    <br>
    <br>**Entertainment:**
    <br>1. **Purpose:** The primary purpose of entertainment is to provide enjoyment, amusement, or diversion. It aims to engage and captivate an audience, often for the purpose of relaxation or recreation.
    <br>2. **Audience-Centric:** Entertainment is generally designed with the audience in mind. It seeks to appeal to a broad audience and elicit positive reactions, such as laughter, excitement, or emotional engagement.
    <br>3. **Commercial Aspect:** While art can also be commercialized, entertainment often has a more explicit commercial focus. The success of entertainment is often measured by its popularity, ticket sales, viewership, or other quantitative metrics.
    <br>4. **Conventions and Familiarity:** Entertainment often relies on familiar conventions, genres, and formats. This can include popular music, mainstream films, television shows, and other forms that cater to broad tastes.
    <br>5. **Immediacy and Accessibility:** Entertainment is often more immediate and accessible than art. It is designed to capture attention quickly and provide immediate gratification or enjoyment.
    <br>
    <br>It's important to note that there can be overlap between arts and entertainment, and the distinction is not always clear-cut. Many works, such as films or performances, may have artistic and entertainment value simultaneously. Additionally, what one person considers art, another may perceive as entertainment. The boundaries between these concepts can be fluid and depend on individual perspectives and cultural contexts."

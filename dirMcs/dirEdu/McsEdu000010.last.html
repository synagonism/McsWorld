    <br>"lexicon vs vocabulary vs dictionary vs glossary
    <br>Certainly, let's clarify the differences between these terms:
    <br>* Lexicon: A lexicon is a comprehensive collection of words and phrases within a language, along with their meanings, pronunciations, grammatical information, and sometimes cultural or historical context. It represents the entire vocabulary of a language and provides a deeper understanding of how words are used and related to each other.
    <br>* Vocabulary: Vocabulary refers to the specific set of words that an individual or a group of people knows and uses in their communication. It's a subset of the larger lexicon. A person's vocabulary might include words they commonly use and understand, while the lexicon encompasses all words existing in the language.
    <br>* Dictionary: A dictionary is a reference book or digital resource that compiles words from a language's lexicon along with their definitions, pronunciations, parts of speech, and sometimes example sentences or phrases. Dictionaries are used to look up the meanings and usages of words that are unfamiliar or unclear.
    <br>* Glossary: A glossary is a specialized type of list that provides explanations or definitions for terms, phrases, or words used within a specific context, field, or subject area. Glossaries are often found in textbooks, technical manuals, or academic papers to clarify terminology for readers who might not be familiar with the specialized jargon of the subject.
    <br>In summary, while all these terms are related to language and words, they have distinct meanings:
    <br>* Lexicon: The complete set of words and phrases in a language, including meanings and linguistic details.
    <br>* Vocabulary: The subset of words that an individual or group knows and uses.
    <br>* Dictionary: A comprehensive reference containing definitions, pronunciations, and other word-related information.
    <br>* Glossary: A list of specialized terms with explanations, typically in a specific field or context."

    <br>"terminology vs vocabulary
    <br>"Terminology" and "vocabulary" are related concepts in the realm of language and communication, but they have distinct meanings:
    <br>* Vocabulary: Vocabulary refers to the set of words that an individual, community, or group of people knows and uses in their communication. It encompasses the words one is familiar with and can employ in speech or writing. Vocabulary can be broad or limited, depending on a person's language proficiency, interests, and exposure. It's a more general term that describes the range of words a person uses across various contexts.
    <br>* Terminology: Terminology, on the other hand, is a specialized subset of vocabulary that is specific to a particular field, subject, or domain. It consists of technical terms, jargon, and specialized language used within a certain profession, industry, discipline, or area of study. Terminology is characterized by its precision and often has well-defined meanings within its context. It's used to convey nuanced concepts and ideas accurately and efficiently among experts within that domain.
    <br>In summary, vocabulary is the broader collection of words that a person knows and uses, while terminology refers to the specialized language and terms used within a particular field or domain."

    <br>"Jargon is the specialized terminology associated with a particular field or area of activity.[1] Jargon is normally employed in a particular communicative context and may not be well understood outside that context. The context is usually a particular occupation (that is, a certain trade, profession, vernacular or academic field), but any ingroup can have jargon. The main trait that distinguishes jargon from the rest of a language is special vocabulary—including some words specific to it and often different senses or meanings of words, that outgroups would tend to take in another sense—therefore misunderstanding that communication attempt. Jargon is sometimes understood as a form of technical slang and then distinguished from the official terminology used in a particular field of activity.[2]
    <br>The terms jargon, slang, and argot are not consistently differentiated in the literature; different authors interpret these concepts in varying ways. According to one definition, jargon differs from slang in being secretive in nature;[3] according to another understanding, it is specifically associated with professional and technical circles.[4] Some sources, however, treat these terms as synonymous.[5][6] In Russian linguistics, jargon is classified as an expressive form of language, while secret languages are referred to as argots.[7] The use of jargon became more popular around the sixteenth century attracting persons from different career paths. This led to there being printed copies available on the various forms of jargon.[8]"

A word is the smallest meaningful unit of a language that can stand on its own, and is made up of small components called morphemes and even smaller elements known as phonemes, or distinguishing sounds. Lexicology examines every feature of a word – including formation, spelling, origin, usage, and definition.[1]
    <br>Lexicology also considers the relationships that exist between words. In linguistics, the lexicon of a language is composed of lexemes, which are abstract units of meaning that correspond to a set of related forms of a word. Lexicology looks at how words can be broken down as well as identifies common patterns they follow.[2]
    <br>Lexicology is associated with lexicography, which is the practice of compiling dictionaries.[3]"

    <br>===
    <br>"Lexicography is the study of lexicons, and is divided into two separate but equally important academic disciplines:
    <br>* Practical lexicography is the art or craft of compiling, writing and editing dictionaries.
    <br>* Theoretical lexicography is the scholarly study of semantic, orthographic, syntagmatic and paradigmatic features of lexemes of the lexicon (vocabulary) of a language, developing theories of dictionary components and structures linking the data in dictionaries, the needs for information by users in specific types of situations, and how users may best access the data incorporated in printed and electronic dictionaries. This is sometimes referred to as 'metalexicography'.
    <br>There is some disagreement on the definition of lexicology, as distinct from lexicography. Some use "lexicology" as a synonym for theoretical lexicography; others use it to mean a branch of linguistics pertaining to the inventory of words in a particular language."

  <p id="idSLangwordcrtgdsnL">descriptionLong::
    <br>"In linguistics, morphology (/mɔːrˈfɒlədʒi/[1]) is the study of words, how they are formed, and their relationship to other words in the same language.[2][3] It analyzes the structure of words and parts of words such as stems, root words, prefixes, and suffixes. Morphology also looks at parts of speech, intonation and stress, and the ways context can change a word's pronunciation and meaning. Morphology differs from morphological typology, which is the classification of languages based on their use of words,[4] and lexicology, which is the study of words and how they make up a language's vocabulary.[5]
    <br>While words, along with clitics, are generally accepted as being the smallest units of syntax, in most languages, if not all, many words can be related to other words by rules that collectively describe the grammar for that language. For example, English speakers recognize that the words dog and dogs are closely related, differentiated only by the plurality morpheme "-s", only found bound to noun phrases. Speakers of English, a fusional language, recognize these relations from their innate knowledge of English's rules of word formation. They infer intuitively that dog is to dogs as cat is to cats; and, in similar fashion, dog is to dog catcher as dish is to dishwasher. By contrast, Classical Chinese has very little morphology, using almost exclusively unbound morphemes ("free" morphemes) and depending on word order to convey meaning. (Most words in modern Standard Chinese ["Mandarin"], however, are compounds and most roots are bound.) These are understood as grammars that represent the morphology of the language. The rules understood by a speaker reflect specific patterns or regularities in the way words are formed from smaller units in the language they are using, and how those smaller units interact in speech. In this way, morphology is the branch of linguistics that studies patterns of word formation within and across languages and attempts to formulate rules that model the knowledge of the speakers of those languages.
    <br>Phonological and orthographic modifications between a base word and its origin may be partial to literacy skills. Studies have indicated that the presence of modification in phonology and orthography makes morphologically complex words harder to understand and that the absence of modification between a base word and its origin makes morphologically complex words easier to understand. Morphologically complex words are easier to comprehend when they include a base word.[6]
    <br>Polysynthetic languages, such as Chukchi, have words composed of many morphemes. For example, the Chukchi word "təmeyŋəlevtpəγtərkən", meaning "I have a fierce headache", is composed of eight morphemes t-ə-meyŋ-ə-levt-pəγt-ə-rkən that may be glossed. The morphology of such languages allows for each consonant and vowel to be understood as morphemes, while the grammar of the language indicates the usage and understanding of each morpheme.
    <br>The discipline that deals specifically with the sound changes occurring within morphemes is morphophonology."

    <br>Naming "things" is a part of general human communication using words and language: it is an aspect of everyday taxonomy as people distinguish the objects of their experience, together with their similarities and differences, which observers identify, name and classify. The use of names, as the many different kinds of nouns embedded in different languages, connects nomenclature to theoretical linguistics, while the way humans mentally structure the world in relation to word meanings and experience relates to the philosophy of language.
    <br>Onomastics, the study of proper names and their origins, includes: anthroponymy (concerned with human names, including personal names, surnames and nicknames); toponymy (the study of place names); and etymology (the derivation, history and use of names) as revealed through comparative and descriptive linguistics.
    <br>The scientific need for simple, stable and internationally accepted systems for naming objects of the natural world has generated many formal nomenclatural systems.[citation needed] Probably the best known of these nomenclatural systems are the five codes of biological nomenclature that govern the Latinized scientific names of organisms."

    <br>"A chemical nomenclature is a set of rules to generate systematic names for chemical compounds. The nomenclature used most frequently worldwide is the one created and developed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).
    <br>The IUPAC's rules for naming organic and inorganic compounds are contained in two publications, known as the Blue Book[1][2] and the Red Book,[3] respectively. A third publication, known as the Green Book,[4] describes the recommendations for the use of symbols for physical quantities (in association with the IUPAP), while a fourth, the Gold Book,[5] contains the definitions of many technical terms used in chemistry. Similar compendia exist for biochemistry[6] (the White Book, in association with the IUBMB), analytical chemistry[7] (the Orange Book), macromolecular chemistry[8] (the Purple Book) and clinical chemistry[9] (the Silver Book). These "color books" are supplemented by shorter recommendations for specific circumstances that are published periodically in the journal Pure and Applied Chemistry."

    <br>"Terminology is a group of specialized words and respective meanings in a particular field, and also the study of such terms and their use;[1] the latter meaning is also known as terminology science. A term is a word, compound word, or multi-word expressions that in specific contexts is given specific meanings—these may deviate from the meanings the same words have in other contexts and in everyday language.[2] Terminology is a discipline that studies, among other things, the development of such terms and their interrelationships within a specialized domain. Terminology differs from lexicography, as it involves the study of concepts, conceptual systems and their labels (terms), whereas lexicography studies words and their meanings.
    <br>Terminology is a discipline that systematically studies the "labelling or designating of concepts" particular to one or more subject fields or domains of human activity. It does this through the research and analysis of terms in context for the purpose of documenting and promoting consistent usage. Terminology can be limited to one or more languages (for example, "multilingual terminology" and "bilingual terminology"), or may have an interdisciplinarity focus on the use of terms in different fields."

    <br>"Etymology (/ˌɛtɪˈmɒlədʒi/)[1] is the study of the history of the form of words[2] and, by extension, the origin and evolution of their semantic meaning across time.[3] It is a subfield of historical linguistics, and draws upon comparative semantics, morphology, semiotics, and phonetics.
    <br>For languages with a long written history, etymologists make use of texts, and texts about the language, to gather knowledge about how words were used during earlier periods, how they developed in meaning and form, or when and how they entered the language. Etymologists also apply the methods of comparative linguistics to reconstruct information about forms that are too old for any direct information to be available. By analyzing related languages with a technique known as the comparative method, linguists can make inferences about their shared parent language and its vocabulary. In this way, word roots in European languages, for example, can be traced all the way back to the origin of the Indo-European language family.
    <br>Even though etymological research originated from the philological tradition, much current etymological research is done on language families where little or no early documentation is available, such as Uralic and Austronesian."

    <br>"The linguistics wars were a protracted academic dispute inside American theoretical linguistics that took place mostly in the 1960s and 1970s, stemming from an intellectual falling out between Noam Chomsky and some of his early colleagues and doctoral students. The debate began in 1967,[1] when linguists Paul Postal, "Haj" Ross, George Lakoff, and James McCawley—self-dubbed the "Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse" (in reference to the Book of Revelation)—proposed an approach to the relationship between syntax and semantics, which treated deep structures as meanings rather than syntactic objects.[2] While Chomsky and other generative grammarians argued that the meaning of a sentence was derived from its syntax, the generative semanticists argued that syntax was derived from meaning."

    <br>Areas of study
    <br>Cognitive linguistics is divided into three main areas of study:
    <br>* Cognitive semantics, dealing mainly with lexical semantics
    <br>* Cognitive approaches to grammar, dealing mainly with syntax, morphology and other traditionally more grammar-oriented areas.
    <br>* Cognitive phonology.
    <br>Aspects of cognition that are of interest to cognitive linguists include:
    <br>* Construction grammar and cognitive grammar.
    <br>* Conceptual metaphor and conceptual blending.
    <br>* Image schemas and force dynamics.
    <br>* Conceptual organization: Categorization, Metonymy, Frame semantics, and Iconicity.
    <br>* Construal and Subjectivity.
    <br>* Gesture and sign language.
    <br>* Linguistic relativism.
    <br>* Cognitive neuroscience.
    <br>Related work that interfaces with many of the above themes:
    <br>* Computational models of metaphor and language acquisition.
    <br>* Psycholinguistics research.
    <br>* Conceptual semantics, pursued by generative linguist Ray Jackendoff is related because of its active psychological realism and the incorporation of prototype structure and images.
    <br>Cognitive linguistics, more than generative linguistics, seek to mesh together these findings into a coherent whole. A further complication arises because the terminology of cognitive linguistics is not entirely stable, both because it is a relatively new field and because it interfaces with a number of other disciplines.
    <br>Insights and developments from cognitive linguistics are becoming accepted ways of analysing literary texts, too. Cognitive Poetics, as it has become known, has become an important part of modern stylistics. The best summary of the discipline as it is currently stands is Peter Stockwell's Cognitive Poetics.[2]

    <br>Computational linguistics is an interdisciplinary field dealing with the statistical and/or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective. This modeling is not limited to any particular field of linguistics.
    <br>... The Association for Computational Linguistics defines computational linguistics as:
    <br>...the scientific study of language from a computational perspective. Computational linguists are interested in providing computational models of various kinds of linguistic phenomena.
    <br>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_linguistics]
    <br>
    <br>Simply put, computational linguistics is the scientific study of language from a computational perspective. Computational linguists are interested in providing computational models of various kinds of linguistic phenomena. These models may be "knowledge-based" ("hand-crafted") or "data-driven" ("statistical" or "empirical"). Work in computational linguistics is in some cases motivated from a scientific perspective in that one is trying to provide a computational explanation for a particular linguistic or psycholinguistic phenomenon; and in other cases the motivation may be more purely technological in that one wants to provide a working component of a speech or natural language system. Indeed, the work of computational linguists is incorporated into many working systems today, including speech recognition systems, text-to-speech synthesizers, automated voice response systems, web search engines, text editors, language instruction materials, to name just a few.

    <br>[2] What is Computational Linguistics
    <br>Computational linguistics (CL) is a discipline between linguistics and  computer science which is concerned with the computational aspects of the  human language faculty. It belongs to the cognitive sciences and overlaps  with the field of artificial intelligence (AI), a branch of computer  science that is aiming at computational models of human cognition.  There are two components of CL: applied and theoretical.
    <br>
    <br>The applied component of CL is more interested in the practical outcome of modelling human language use. The goal is to create software products that have some knowledge of human language.  Such products are urgently needed for improving human-machine interaction since the main obstacle in the interaction beween human and computer is one of communication. Today's computers do not understand our language, and humans have difficulties understand the computer's language, which does not correspond to the structure of human thought.
    <br>Natural language interfaces enable the user to communicate with the  computer in German, English or another human language.  Some applications  of such interfaces are database queries, information retrieval from texts  and so-called expert systems.  Current advances in recognition of spoken  language improve the usability of many types of natural language systems.   Communication with computers using spoken language will have a lasting impact upon the work environment, opening up completely new areas of application for information technology.
    <br>Although existing CL programs are far from achieving human ability, they  have numerous possible applications. Even if the language the machine  understands and its domain of discourse are very restricted, the use of  human language can increase the acceptance of software and the productivity  of its users.
    <br>Much older than communication problems between human beings and machines  are those between people with different mother tongues.  One of the  original goals of applied computational linguistics was fully automatic  translation between human languages.  From bitter experience scientists  have realized that they are far from achieving this.  Nevertheless, computational linguists have created software systems which can simplify  the work of human translators and clearly improve their productivity.
    <br>The future of applied computational linguistics will be determined by the  growing need for user-friendly software.  Even though the successful  simulation of human language competence is not to be expected in the near  future, computational linguists have numerous immediate research goals  involving the design, realization and maintenance of systems which  facilitate everyday work, such as grammar checkers for word processing  programs.
    <br>
    <br>Theoretical CL takes up issues in formal theories. It deals with formal theories about the linguistic knowledge that a human needs for generating and understanding language. Today these theories have reached a degree of complexity that can only be managed by employing computers.  Computational linguists develop formal models simulating aspects of the human language faculty and implement them as computer programmes. These programmes constitute the basis for the evaluation and further development of the theories. In addition to linguistic theories, findings from cognitive psychology play a major role in simulating linguistic competence.  Within psychology, it is mainly the area of psycholinguistics that examines the cognitive processes constituting human language use.
    <br>The special attraction of computational linguistics lies in the combination  of methods and strategies from the humanities, natural and behavioural  sciences, and engineering.

    <br>"The core areas of computational linguistics include:
    <br>* Machine translation (MT): This is the task of automatically translating text from one language to another.
    <br>* Natural language understanding (NLU): This is the task of understanding the meaning of natural language text or speech.
    <br>* Natural language generation (NLG): This is the task of generating natural language text or speech.
    <br>* Speech recognition (SR): This is the task of converting spoken language into text.
    <br>* Text analysis: This is the task of extracting information from text, such as the topic of a document or the sentiment of a piece of writing.
    <br>* Question answering (QA): This is the task of answering questions posed in natural language.
    <br>* Information retrieval (IR): This is the task of finding relevant documents or information from a large corpus of text.
    <br>* Computer-assisted language learning (CALL): This is the use of computers to teach and learn languages."
    <br>[{2023-08-29 retrieved} https://bard.google.com/ computational linguistics overview]
    <br>===
    <br>Computational linguistics can be divided into major areas depending upon the medium of the language being processed, whether spoken or textual; and upon the task being performed, whether analyzing language (parsing) or creating language (generation).
    <br>
    <br>Speech recognition and speech synthesis deal with how spoken language can be understood or created using computers. Parsing and generation are sub-divisions of computational linguistics dealing respectively with taking language apart and putting it together. Machine translation remains the sub-division of computational linguistics dealing with having computers translate between languages.
    <br>
    <br>Some of the areas of research that are studied by computational linguistics include:
    <br>* Computer aided corpus linguistics
    <br>* Design of parsers or chunkers for natural languages
    <br>* Design of taggers like POS-taggers (part-of-speech taggers)

    <br>"computational linguistics subfields
    <br>Computational linguistics is a diverse and multidisciplinary field that focuses on the intersection of linguistics and computer science. It involves developing algorithms, models, and technologies to enable computers to understand, generate, and process human language. Here are some of the key subfields within computational linguistics:
    <br>* Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLP is the most prominent subfield of computational linguistics. It deals with the interaction between computers and human language. NLP involves tasks like machine translation, sentiment analysis, text summarization, named entity recognition, and part-of-speech tagging.
    <br>* Speech Processing: This subfield focuses on speech recognition (converting spoken language into text) and speech synthesis (generating human-like speech from text). Applications include voice assistants, speech-to-text systems, and text-to-speech systems.
    <br>* Text Mining and Information Retrieval: Text mining involves extracting meaningful information from large text corpora, while information retrieval focuses on retrieving relevant documents from a collection based on user queries. These subfields are essential for search engines, document categorization, and data analysis.
    <br>* Machine Translation: Machine translation aims to automatically translate text or speech from one language to another. This subfield has seen significant advancements with the advent of neural machine translation models.
    <br>* Syntax and Grammar Parsing: Parsing involves analyzing the grammatical structure of sentences to understand their syntax. This is crucial for tasks like language generation and understanding.
    <br>* Semantic Analysis: This subfield focuses on understanding the meaning of words, phrases, and sentences. It's important for tasks such as sentiment analysis, question answering, and natural language understanding.
    <br>* Discourse Analysis: Discourse analysis deals with how sentences are organized into coherent conversations or texts. It helps in understanding the relationships between sentences and the overall flow of information.
    <br>* Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining: These subfields involve determining the emotional tone or sentiment expressed in a piece of text. They have applications in social media monitoring, customer reviews, and brand perception analysis.
    <br>* Computational Psycholinguistics: This subfield explores the cognitive processes involved in language production and comprehension, using computational models to simulate how humans process language.
    <br>* Linguistic Resources and Corpora: Creating and maintaining linguistic resources, such as annotated text corpora and lexical databases, is crucial for training and evaluating computational linguistics models.
    <br>* Dialogue Systems: Also known as conversational agents or chatbots, these systems engage in natural language conversations with users. They find applications in customer support, virtual assistants, and interactive systems.
    <br>* Computational Phonetics: This subfield deals with the acoustic and perceptual aspects of speech, often focusing on aspects like speech recognition and speech synthesis.
    <br>* Morphology and Lexicon Processing: Morphology involves studying the structure of words, and lexicon processing deals with building and managing dictionaries and word databases.
    <br>* Cross-Lingual and Multilingual NLP: These subfields address challenges in processing and understanding languages beyond English, as well as developing models that can work with multiple languages.
    <br>These subfields often overlap and interact, leading to innovative approaches and technologies that enable computers to work with human language effectively."

    <br>"computational linguistics subfields
    <br>Computational linguistics is a broad field that encompasses many different subfields. Some of the most common subfields include:
    <br>* Machine translation is the task of automatically translating text from one language to another.
    <br>* Natural language processing (NLP) is a broader field that encompasses all tasks related to the interaction between computers and human language. This includes tasks such as text parsing, text summarization, and question answering.
    <br>* Speech recognition is the task of automatically recognizing spoken words.
    <br>* Speech synthesis is the task of automatically generating spoken words.
    <br>* Corpus linguistics is the study of large collections of text, or corpora. This can be used to study the statistical properties of language, or to develop new NLP algorithms.
    <br>* Parsing is the task of determining the grammatical structure of a sentence.
    <br>* Tagging is the task of assigning labels to words or phrases, such as their part of speech or their syntactic role.
    <br>* Semantics is the study of meaning in language. This can be used to develop NLP algorithms that can understand the meaning of text.
    <br>* Pragmatics is the study of how context contributes to meaning. This can be used to develop NLP algorithms that can understand the meaning of text in a particular context.
    <br>These are just a few of the many subfields of computational linguistics. The field is constantly evolving, and new subfields are being developed all the time.
    <br>Here are some additional concepts in computational linguistics:
    <br>* Tokenization is the process of breaking a text into individual words or tokens.
    <br>* Stemming is the process of reducing inflected words to their stem.
    <br>* Lemmatization is the process of grouping together different inflected forms of a word under a single lemma.
    <br>* Named entity recognition is the task of identifying named entities in text, such as people, places, and organizations.
    <br>* Coreference resolution is the task of determining which words or phrases refer to the same entity.
    <br>* Question answering is the task of automatically answering questions posed in natural language.
    <br>Computational linguistics is a rapidly growing field with many exciting applications. As computers become more powerful and algorithms become more sophisticated, we can expect to see even more advances in this field in the years to come."

    <br>All academic research in linguistics is descriptive; like all other scientific disciplines, it seeks to describe reality, without the bias of preconceived ideas about how it ought to be.[2][3][4][5] Modern descriptive linguistics is based on a structural approach to language, as exemplified in the work of Leonard Bloomfield and others.[6] This type of linguistics utilizes different methods in order to describe a language such as basic data collection, and different types of elicitation methods.[7]"

  <p id="idSLang008dsn">description::
    <br>"Evolutionary linguistics or Darwinian linguistics is a sociobiological approach to the study of language.[1][2] Evolutionary linguists consider linguistics as a subfield of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology. The approach is also closely linked with evolutionary anthropology, cognitive linguistics and biolinguistics. Studying languages as the products of nature, it is interested in the biological origin and development of language.[3] Evolutionary linguistics is contrasted with humanistic approaches, especially structural linguistics.[4]
    <br>A main challenge in this research is the lack of empirical data: there are no archaeological traces of early human language. Computational biological modelling and clinical research with artificial languages have been employed to fill in gaps of knowledge. Although biology is understood to shape the brain, which processes language, there is no clear link between biology and specific human language structures or linguistic universals.[5]
    <br>For lack of a breakthrough in the field, there have been numerous debates about what kind of natural phenomenon language might be. Some researchers focus on the innate aspects of language. It is suggested that grammar has emerged adaptationally from the human genome, bringing about a language instinct;[6] or that it depends on a single mutation[7] which has caused a language organ to appear in the human brain.[8] This is hypothesized to result in a crystalline[9] grammatical structure underlying all human languages. Others suggest language is not crystallized, but fluid and ever-changing.[10] Others, yet, liken languages to living organisms.[11] Languages are considered analogous to a parasite[12] or populations of mind-viruses. There is so far little scientific evidence for any of these claims, and some of them have been labelled as pseudoscience.[13][14]"

    <br>"functional linguistics definition
    <br>Functional linguistics is a linguistic approach and theory that focuses on the functional aspects of language, emphasizing how language is used for communication and the roles it serves in various social and cultural contexts. It is concerned with the study of meaning, the analysis of language in its context, and the examination of language as a tool for expressing and negotiating meaning in real-life situations. Functional linguistics explores how language functions in communication, how it conveys information, and how it is influenced by social, cultural, and situational factors. This approach stands in contrast to structural or formal linguistics, which primarily focuses on the internal structures and rules of language."

    <br>"Historical linguistics, also termed diachronic linguistics, is the scientific study of language change over time.[1] Principal concerns of historical linguistics include:[2]
    <br>* to describe and account for observed changes in particular languages
    <br>* to reconstruct the pre-history of languages and to determine their relatedness, grouping them into language families (comparative linguistics)
    <br>* to develop general theories about how and why language changes
    <br>* to describe the history of speech communities
    <br>* to study the history of words, i.e. etymology
    <br>Historical linguistics is founded on the Uniformitarian Principle, which is defined by linguist Donald Ringe as:[3]
    <br>Unless we can demonstrate significant changes in the conditions of language acquisition and use between some time in the unobservable past and the present, we must assume that the same types and distributions of structures, variation, changes, etc. existed at that time in the past as in the present."

It can overlap with the sociology of language, which focuses on the effect of language on society. Sociolinguistics overlaps considerably with pragmatics and is closely related to linguistic anthropology.
    <br>Sociolinguistics' historical interrelation with anthropology[1] can be observed in studies of how language varieties differ between groups separated by social variables (e.g., ethnicity, religion, status, gender, level of education, age, etc.) and/or geographical barriers (a mountain range, a desert, a river, etc.). Such studies also examine how such differences in usage and differences in beliefs about usage produce and reflect social or socioeconomic classes. As the usage of a language varies from place to place, language usage also varies among social classes, and it is these sociolects that sociolinguistics studies.
    <br>Sociolinguistics can be studied in various ways such as interviews with speakers of a language, matched-guise tests, and other observations or studies related to dialects and speaking."

    <br>"Linguistic prescription, or prescriptive grammar, is the establishment of rules defining preferred usage of language.[1][2] These rules may address such linguistic aspects as spelling, pronunciation, vocabulary, syntax, and semantics. Sometimes informed by linguistic purism,[3] such normative practices often suggest that some usages are incorrect, inconsistent, illogical, lack communicative effect, or are of low aesthetic value, even in cases where such usage is more common than the prescribed usage.[4][5] They may also include judgments on socially proper and politically correct language use.[6]
    <br>Linguistic prescriptivism may aim to establish a standard language, teach what a particular society or sector of a society perceives as a correct or proper form, or advise on effective and stylistically felicitous communication. If usage preferences are conservative, prescription might appear resistant to language change; if radical, it may produce neologisms.[7]
    <br>Prescriptive approaches to language are often contrasted with the descriptive approach, employed in academic linguistics, which observes and records how language is actually used without any judgment.[8][9] The basis of linguistic research is text (corpus) analysis and field study, both of which are descriptive activities. Description may also include researchers' observations of their own language usage. In the Eastern European linguistic tradition, the discipline dealing with standard language cultivation and prescription is known as "language culture" or "speech culture".[10][11]
    <br>Despite being apparent opposites, prescriptive and descriptive approaches have a certain degree of conceptual overlap[12] as comprehensive descriptive accounts must take into account and record existing speaker preferences, and a prior understanding of how language is actually used is necessary for prescription to be effective. Since the mid-20th century some dictionaries and style guides, which are prescriptive works by nature, have increasingly integrated descriptive material and approaches. Examples of guides updated to add more descriptive material include Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1961) and the third edition Garner's Modern English Usage (2009) in English, or the Nouveau Petit Robert (1993)[13] in French. A partially descriptive approach can be especially useful when approaching topics of ongoing conflict between authorities, or in different dialects, disciplines, styles, or registers. Other guides, such as The Chicago Manual of Style, are designed to impose a single style and thus remain primarily prescriptive (as of 2017).
    <br>Some authors define "prescriptivism" as the concept where a certain language variety is promoted as linguistically superior to others, thus recognizing the standard language ideology as a constitutive element of prescriptivism or even identifying prescriptivism with this system of views.[14][15] Others, however, use this term in relation to any attempts to recommend or mandate a particular way of language usage (in a specific context or register), without, however, implying that these practices must involve propagating the standard language ideology.[16][17] According to another understanding, the prescriptive attitude is an approach to norm-formulating and codification that involves imposing arbitrary rulings upon a speech community,[18] as opposed to more liberal approaches that draw heavily from descriptive surveys;[19][20] in a wider sense, however, the latter also constitute a form of prescriptivism.[10]
    <br>Mate Kapović makes a distinction between "prescription" and "prescriptivism", defining the former as "process of codification of a certain variety of language for some sort of official use", and the latter as "an unscientific tendency to mystify linguistic prescription".[21]"

    <br>"Psycholinguistics or psychology of language is the study of the interrelation between linguistic factors and psychological aspects.[1] The discipline is mainly concerned with the mechanisms by which language is processed and represented in the mind and brain; that is, the psychological and neurobiological factors that enable humans to acquire, use, comprehend, and produce language.[2]
    <br>Psycholinguistics is concerned with the cognitive faculties and processes that are necessary to produce the grammatical constructions of language. It is also concerned with the perception of these constructions by a listener.
    <br>Initial forays into psycholinguistics were in the philosophical and educational fields, due mainly to their location in departments other than applied sciences (e.g., cohesive data on how the human brain functioned). Modern research makes use of biology, neuroscience, cognitive science, linguistics, and information science to study how the mind-brain processes language, and less so the known processes of social sciences, human development, communication theories, and infant development, among others.
    <br>There are several subdisciplines with non-invasive techniques for studying the neurological workings of the brain. For example, neurolinguistics has become a field in its own right, and developmental psycholinguistics, as a branch of psycholinguistics, concerns itself with a child's ability to learn language."

    <br>Psycholinguistics or psychology of language is the study of the psychological and neurobiological factors that enable humans to acquire, use, and understand language. Initial forays into psycholinguistics were largely philosophical ventures, due mainly to a lack of cohesive data on how the human brain functioned. Modern research makes use of biology, neuroscience, cognitive science, and information theory to study how the brain processes language.

    <br>
    <br>The 20th Century has seen the emergence of psycholinguistics, an interdisciplinary field of research concerned with the cognitive bases of linguistic competence. Both linguists and psycholinguists have explored in considerable depth the factors determining the contemporary (synchronic) structure of linguistic knowledge in general, and lexical knowledge in particular—  Miller and Johnson-Laird (1976) have proposed that research concerned with the lexical component of language should be called psycholexicology. As linguistic theories evolved in recent decades, linguists became increasingly explicit about the information a lexicon must contain in order for the phonological, syntactic, and lexical components to work together in the everyday production and comprehension of linguistic messages, and those proposals have been incorporated into the work of psycholinguists. Beginning with word association studies at the turn of the century and continuing down to the sophisticated experimental tasks of the past twenty years, psycholinguists have discovered many synchronic properties of the mental lexicon that can be exploited in lexicography.

    <br>Within psychology, it is mainly the area of psycholinguistics that examines the cognitive processes constituting human language use.

    <br>"Structural linguistics, or structuralism, in linguistics, denotes schools or theories in which language is conceived as a self-contained, self-regulating semiotic system whose elements are defined by their relationship to other elements within the system.[1][2] It is derived from the work of Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure and is part of the overall approach of structuralism. Saussure's Course in General Linguistics, published posthumously in 1916, stressed examining language as a dynamic system of interconnected units. Saussure is also known for introducing several basic dimensions of semiotic analysis that are still important today. Two of these are his key methods of syntagmatic and paradigmatic analysis,[3] which define units syntactically and lexically, respectively, according to their contrast with the other units in the system.
    <br>Structuralism as a term, however, was not used by Saussure, who called the approach semiology. The term structuralism is derived from sociologist Émile Durkheim's anti-Darwinian modification of Herbert Spencer's organic analogy which draws a parallel between social structures and the organs of an organism which have different functions or purposes.[4] Similar analogies and metaphors were used in the historical-comparative linguistics that Saussure was part of.[5][6] Saussure himself made a modification of August Schleicher's language–species analogy, based on William Dwight Whitney's critical writings, to turn focus to the internal elements of the language organism, or system.[7] Nonetheless, structural linguistics became mainly associated with Saussure's notion of language as a dual interactive system of symbols and concepts. The term structuralism was adopted to linguistics after Saussure's death by the Prague school linguists Roman Jakobson and Nikolai Trubetzkoy; while the term structural linguistics was coined by Louis Hjelmslev.[8]"

    <br>"Theory of language is a topic from philosophy of language and theoretical linguistics.[1] It has the goal of answering the questions "What is language?";[2][3] "Why do languages have the properties they have?";[4] or "What is the origin of language?". In addition to these fundamental questions, the theory of language also seeks to understand how language is acquired and used by individuals and communities. This involves investigating the cognitive and neural processes involved in language processing and production, as well as the social and cultural factors that shape linguistic behavior.[5]
    <br>Even though much of the research in linguistics is descriptive or prescriptive, there exists an underlying assumption that terminological and methodological choices reflect the researcher's opinion of language. These choices often stem from the theoretical framework a linguist subscribes to, shaping their interpretation of linguistic phenomena. For instance, within the generative grammar framework, linguists might focus on underlying syntactic structures, while cognitive linguists might emphasize the role of conceptual metaphor.[6][7] Linguists are divided into different schools of thinking, with the nature–nurture debate as the main divide.[8] Some linguistics conferences and journals are focussed on a specific theory of language, while others disseminate a variety of views.[9]
    <br>Like in other human and social sciences, theories in linguistics can be divided into humanistic and sociobiological approaches.[10] Same terms, for example 'rationalism', 'functionalism', 'formalism' and 'constructionism', are used with different meanings in different contexts.[11]"

    <br>Theoretical linguistics is a term in linguistics which,[1] like the related term general linguistics,[2] can be understood in different ways. Both can be taken as a reference to theory of language, or the branch of linguistics which inquires into the nature of language and seeks to answer fundamental questions as to what language is, or what the common ground of all languages is.[2] The goal of theoretical linguistics can also be the construction of a general theoretical framework for the description of language.[1]
    <br>Another use of the term depends on the organisation of linguistics into different sub-fields. The term theoretical linguistics is commonly juxtaposed with applied linguistics.[3] This perspective implies that the aspiring language professional, e.g. a teacher student, must first learn the theory i.e. properties of the linguistic system, or what Ferdinand de Saussure called internal linguistics.[4] This is followed by practice, or studies in the applied field. The dichotomy is not fully unproblematic because language pedagogy, language technology and other aspects of applied linguistics include theory, too.[3]
    <br>Similarly, the term general linguistics is used to distinguish core linguistics from other types of study. However, because college and university linguistics is largely distributed with the institutes and departments of a relatively small number of national languages, some larger universities also offer courses and research programmes in 'general linguistics' which may cover exotic and minority languages, cross-linguistic studies and various other topics outside the scope of the main philological departments.[5]
    <br>
    <br>Fields of linguistics proper
    <br>When the concept of theoretical linguistics is taken as referring to core or internal linguistics, it means the study of the parts of the language system. This traditionally means phonology, morphology, syntax and semantics. Pragmatics and discourse can also be included; delimitation varies between institutions. Furthermore, Saussure's definition of general linguistics consists of the dichotomy of synchronic and diachronic linguistics, thus including historical linguistics as a core issue.[4]

    <br>Theoretical linguistics is the branch of linguistics that is most concerned with developing models of linguistic knowledge. Part of this endeavor involves the search for and explanation of linguistic universals, that is, properties all languages have in common. The fields that are generally considered the core of theoretical linguistics are syntax, phonology, morphology, and semantics. Although phonetics often informs phonology, it is often excluded from the purview of theoretical linguistics, along with psycholinguistics and sociolinguistics.

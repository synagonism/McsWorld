    <br>"is politics science?
    	<br>Whether or not politics is a science is a matter of debate. Some people argue that politics is too complex and unpredictable to be studied scientifically, while others believe that the same principles of scientific inquiry can be applied to the study of politics as to any other field.
    <br>There is no doubt that political science is a rigorous academic discipline. Political scientists use a variety of methods to study politics, including surveys, experiments, and case studies. They also develop and test theories about political behavior and institutions.
    <br>However, there are some key differences between political science and the natural sciences. One difference is that political scientists often cannot conduct controlled experiments. For example, it would be unethical to experiment with different policies to see which one is most effective in reducing crime.
    <br>Another difference is that political science deals with human beings, who are complex and unpredictable. This makes it difficult to make generalizations about political behavior.
    <br>Despite these challenges, political science has made significant progress in understanding the nature of politics. Political scientists have developed theories about how elections are won, how governments make decisions, and how public opinion is formed. They have also studied the impact of different policies on people's lives.
    <br>So, is politics a science? It depends on how you define science. If you define science as the systematic study of the natural world through observation and experiment, then politics is not a science in the same way that physics or chemistry are. However, if you define science more broadly as the systematic study of any phenomenon, then politics can be considered a science.
    <br>Ultimately, whether or not you consider politics to be a science is a matter of personal opinion. There is no right or wrong answer."

    <br>"political science evolution
    <br>Political science is the social science that studies the theory and practice of government and politics. It is a broad field that encompasses a wide range of topics, including political institutions, political behavior, political thought, and international relations.
    <br>
    <br>The evolution of political science can be traced back to the ancient Greeks, who were the first to systematically study politics and government. Aristotle is considered to be the father of political science, and his work *Politics* is one of the most important texts in the field.
    <br>
    <br>In the Middle Ages, political science was largely dominated by religious thought. However, during the Renaissance, there was a revival of interest in classical political thought, and political science began to develop as a more independent discipline.
    <br>
    <br>In the 19th century, political science began to emerge as a modern academic discipline. This was due in part to the rise of nationalism and the development of new political systems, such as democracy and socialism. Political scientists also began to adopt more scientific methods in their research.
    <br>
    <br>In the 20th century, political science experienced a period of rapid growth. This was due in part to the two world wars and the Cold War, which led to a renewed interest in political issues. Political scientists also began to develop new subfields, such as comparative politics, international relations, and public policy.
    <br>
    <br>Today, political science is a thriving discipline that is taught at universities all over the world. Political scientists play an important role in society by conducting research, teaching, and advising policymakers.
    <br>
    <br>Here are some of the key trends in the evolution of political science:
    <br>* A shift from normative to empirical research: Early political scientists were primarily interested in prescribing how governments should be organized and run. However, in the late 19th century, political scientists began to focus on conducting empirical research to understand how political systems actually work.
    <br>* The rise of subfields: As political science has grown, it has become increasingly specialized. Political scientists now specialize in a variety of subfields, such as comparative politics, international relations, public policy, and political theory.
    <br>* The development of new research methods: Political scientists have developed a wide range of research methods, including surveys, experiments, and case studies. These methods allow political scientists to collect data and test hypotheses about political phenomena.
    <br>* The globalization of political science: Political science has become increasingly globalized in recent years. Political scientists now study a wide range of political systems, from democracies to dictatorships. They also study the growing interconnectedness of political systems around the world.
    <br>
    <br>Political science is a dynamic and ever-evolving field. As new political challenges emerge, political scientists develop new theories and methods to study them. Political science is essential for understanding the complex world of politics and government."

    <br>"International Relations (IR) are the interactions among sovereign states. The scientific study of those interactions is called international studies, international politics,[2] or international affairs.[3] In a broader sense, it concerns all activities among states—such as war, diplomacy, trade, and foreign policy—as well as relations with and among other international actors, such as intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs), international legal bodies, and multinational corporations (MNCs).[4][5] There are several schools of thought within IR, of which the most prominent are realism, liberalism, and constructivism.
    <br>International relations is widely classified as a major subdiscipline of political science, along with comparative politics, political theory, political methodology, and public administration.[6][7] It also often draws heavily from other fields, including anthropology, economics, geography, law, philosophy, sociology, and history.[8]
    <br>While international politics has been analyzed since antiquity, international relations did not become a discrete field until 1919, when it was first offered as an undergraduate major by Aberystwyth University in the United Kingdom.[6][9] After the Second World War, international relations burgeoned in both importance and scholarship—particularly in North America and Western Europe—partly in response to the geostrategic concerns of the Cold War. The collapse of the Soviet Union and subsequent rise of globalization in the late 20th century presaged new theories and evaluations of the rapidly changing international system.[10]"

    <br>"Public policy is an institutionalized proposal or a decided set of elements like laws, regulations, guidelines, and actions[1][2] to solve or address relevant and real-world problems, guided by a conception[3] and often implemented by programs. The implementation of public policy is known as public administration. Public policy can be considered to be the sum of a government's direct and indirect activities[4] and has been conceptualized in a variety of ways.
    <br>They are created and/or enacted on behalf of the public typically by a government. Sometimes they are made by nonprofit organizations[5] or are made in co-production with communities or citizens,[6][7] which can include potential experts,[8][9][10] scientists, engineers and stakeholders or scientific data, or sometimes use[11][12] some of their results. They are typically made[how?] by policy-makers affiliated with (in democratic polities) currently elected politicians. Therefore, the "policy process is a complex political process in which there are many actors: elected politicians, political party leaders, pressure groups, civil servants, publicly employed professionals, judges, non-governmental organizations, international agencies, academic experts, journalists and even sometimes citizens who see themselves as the passive recipients of policy."[13]
    <br>A popular way of understanding and engaging in public policy is through a series of stages known as "the policy cycle", which was first discussed by the political scientist Harold Laswell in his book The Decision Process: Seven Categories of Functional Analysis, published in 1956. The characterization of particular stages can vary, but a basic sequence is agenda setting, policy formulation, legitimation, implementation, and evaluation. "It divides the policy process into a series of stages, from a notional starting point at which policymakers begin to think about a policy problem to a notional end point at which a policy has been implemented and policymakers think about how successful it has been before deciding what to do next."[14]
    <br>Officials considered as policymakers bear responsibility to reflect the interests of a host of different stakeholders. Policy design entails conscious and deliberate effort to define policy aims and map them instrumentally. Academics and other experts in policy studies have developed a range of tools and approaches to help in this task."

    <br>"Political philosophy or political theory is the philosophical study of government, addressing questions about the nature, scope, and legitimacy of public agents and institutions and the relationships between them. Its topics include politics, liberty, justice, property, rights, law, and the enforcement of laws by authority: what they are, if they are needed, what makes a government legitimate, what rights and freedoms it should protect, what form it should take, what the law is, and what duties citizens owe to a legitimate government, if any, and when it may be legitimately overthrown, if ever.
    <br>Political theory also engages questions of a broader scope, tackling the political nature of phenomena and categories such as identity, culture, sexuality, race, wealth, human-nonhuman relations, ethics, religion, and more.
    <br>Political science, the scientific study of politics, is generally used in the singular, but in French and Spanish the plural (sciences politiques and ciencias políticas, respectively) is used, perhaps a reflection of the discipline's eclectic nature.[1]
    <br>Political philosophy is a branch of philosophy,[2] but it has also played a major part of political science, within which a strong focus has historically been placed on both the history of political thought and contemporary political theory (from normative political theory to various critical approaches).
    <br>In the Oxford Handbook of Political Theory (2009), the field is described as: "[...] an interdisciplinary endeavor whose center of gravity lies at the humanities end of the happily still undisciplined discipline of political science ... For a long time, the challenge for the identity of political theory has been how to position itself productively in three sorts of location: in relation to the academic disciplines of political science, history, and philosophy; between the world of politics and the more abstract, ruminative register of theory; between canonical political theory and the newer resources (such as feminist and critical theory, discourse analysis, film and film theory, popular and political culture, mass media studies, neuroscience, environmental studies, behavioral science, and economics) on which political theorists increasingly draw."[3]"

    <br>"Management science (or managerial science) is a wide and interdisciplinary study of solving complex problems and making strategic decisions as it pertains to institutions, corporations, governments and other types of organizational entities. It is closely related to management, economics, business, engineering, management consulting, and other fields. It uses various scientific research-based principles, strategies, and analytical methods including mathematical modeling, statistics and numerical algorithms and aims to improve an organization's ability to enact rational and accurate management decisions by arriving at optimal or near optimal solutions to complex decision problems.[1]: 113 
    <br>Management science looks to help businesses achieve goals using a number of scientific methods. The field was initially an outgrowth of applied mathematics, where early challenges were problems relating to the optimization of systems which could be modeled linearly, i.e., determining the optima (maximum value of profit, assembly line performance, crop yield, bandwidth, etc. or minimum of loss, risk, costs, etc.) of some objective function. Today, the discipline of management science may encompass a diverse range of managerial and organizational activity as it regards to a problem which is structured in mathematical or other quantitative form in order to derive managerially relevant insights and solutions.[2][3]"

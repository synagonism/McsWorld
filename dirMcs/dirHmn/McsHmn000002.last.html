    <br>"Homo (from Latin homō 'human') is the genus that emerged in the (otherwise extinct) genus Australopithecus that encompasses the extant species Homo sapiens (modern humans), plus several extinct species classified as either ancestral to or closely related to modern humans (depending on the species), most notably Homo erectus and Homo neanderthalensis. The oldest member of Homo is Homo habilis with records of just over 2 million years ago.[a] However, a recent phylogenetic study in hominins using morphological, molecular and radiometric information, dates the emergence of Homo at 3.3 Ma (4.30 – 2.56 Ma). [4] Homo, together with the genus Paranthropus, is probably sister to Australopithecus africanus, which itself had previously split from the lineage of Pan, the chimpanzees.[b][5][6]"

    <br>"Humans (Homo sapiens) are the only extant members of the subtribe Hominina. Together with chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans, they are part of the family Hominidae (the great apes, or hominids). A terrestrial animal, humans are characterized by their erect posture and bipedal locomotion; high manual dexterity and heavy tool use compared to other animals; open-ended and complex language use compared to other animal communications; larger, more complex brains than other animals; and highly advanced and organized societies.[3][4]
    <br>Early hominins—particularly the australopithecines, whose brains and anatomy are in many ways more similar to ancestral non-human apes—are less often referred to as "human" than hominins of the genus Homo.[5] Several of these hominins used fire, occupied much of Eurasia, and gave rise to anatomically modern Homo sapiens in Africa about 315,000[6] years ago.[7][8] Humans began to exhibit evidence of behavioral modernity around 50,000 years ago, and in several waves of migration, they ventured out of Africa and populated most of the world.[9]
    <br>The spread of the large and increasing population of humans has profoundly affected much of the biosphere and millions of species worldwide. Advantages that explain this evolutionary success include a larger brain with a well-developed neocortex, prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes, which enable advanced abstract reasoning, language, problem solving, sociality, and culture through social learning. Humans use tools more frequently and effectively than any other animal; and are the only extant species to build fires, cook food, clothe themselves, and create and use numerous other technologies and arts.
    <br>Humans uniquely use such systems of symbolic communication as language and art to express themselves and exchange ideas, and also organize themselves into purposeful groups. Humans create complex social structures composed of many cooperating and competing groups, from families and kinship networks to political states. Social interactions between humans have established an extremely wide variety of values,[10] social norms, and rituals, which together undergird human society. Curiosity and the human desire to understand and influence the environment and to explain and manipulate phenomena (or events) have motivated humanity's development of science, philosophy, mythology, religion, anthropology, and numerous other fields of knowledge.
    <br>Though most of human existence has been sustained by hunting and gathering in band societies,[11] increasingly many human societies transitioned to sedentary agriculture approximately some 10,000 years ago,[12] domesticating plants and animals, thus enabling the growth of civilization. These human societies subsequently expanded, establishing various forms of government, religion, and culture around the world, and unifying people within regions to form states and empires. The rapid advancement of scientific and medical understanding in the 19th and 20th centuries permitted the development of fuel-driven technologies and increased lifetimes, causing the human population to rise exponentially. The global human population was estimated to be near 7.7 billion in 2019.[13]"

    <br>"In some cultures, a surname, family name, or last name is the portion of one's personal name that indicates their family, tribe or community.[1]
    <br>Practices vary by culture. The family name may be placed at either the start of a person's full name, as the forename, or at the end; the number of surnames given to an individual also varies. As the surname indicates genetic inheritance, all members of a family unit may have identical surnames or there may be variations. It is common to see two or more words in a surname, such as in compound surnames. Compound surnames can be composed of separate names, such as in traditional Spanish culture, they can be hyphenated together, or may contain prefixes.
    <br>Using names has been documented in even the oldest historical records. Examples of surnames are documented in the 11th century by the barons in England.[2] Surnames began as a way of identifying a certain aspect of that individual, such as by trade, father's name, location of birth, or physical features.[2] It was not until the 15th century that surnames were used to denote inheritance.[2]"

Around the world, matronymic surnames are far less common than patronymic surnames.[citation needed] In some cultures in the past, matronymic last names were often given to children of unwed mothers. Or if a woman was especially well known or powerful, her descendants might adopt a matronym based on her name. A matronymic is a derived name, as compared to a matriname, which is an inherited name from a mother's side of the family, and which is unchanged."

  <p id="idHmnatt094Tpncdsn">description::
    <br>"A toponymic surname or topographic surname is a surname derived from a place name.[1] This can include specific locations, such as the individual's place of origin, residence, or of lands that they held, or can be more generic, derived from topographic features.[2]
    <br>Toponymic surnames originated as non-hereditary personal by-names, and only subsequently came to be family names. The origins of toponymic by-names have been attributed to two non-mutually exclusive trends. One was to link the nobility to their places of origin and their feudal holdings and provide a marker of their status, while the other relates to the growth of the burgher class in the cities, partly via migration from the countryside. In London in the 13th century, toponymic surnames came to predominate. Also linked to this process was the increased popularity of the names of saints, leading to a reduction in the pool of given names used and the need or personal desire for by-names to distinguish increasing numbers of like-named individuals.[2]
    <br>Some forms originally included a preposition, such as at (ten in Dutch, zu in German), by, in, or of (de in French and Spanish, van in Dutch, von in German), subsequently dropped, as in "de Guzmán" (of Guzman) becoming simply Guzmán. While the disappearance of the preposition has been linked to toponymic by-names becoming inherited family names, it predates this trend. In England, this can be seen as early as the 11th century, and although there is some regional variation, a significant shift away from preposition usage can be seen to have occurred during the 14th century.[3] In some cases, the preposition has coalesced into the name,[4] such as Atwood (at wood)[5] and Daubney (originating as de Albigni, from Saint-Martin-d'Aubigny).[6] In the aristocratic societies of Europe, both nobiliary and non-nobiliary forms of toponymic surnames exist, and in some languages a degree of differentiation evolved in their treatment. For nobles, the preposition evolved into a nobiliary particle, and in French, for example, a trend evolved in which non-nobiliary forms tended to fuse the preposition whereas nobiliary forms retained it as the discrete particle, although this was never an invariable practice.
    <br>Issues such as local pronunciation can cause toponymic surnames to take a form that varies significantly from the toponym that gave rise to them. Examples include Wyndham, derived from Wymondham, Anster from Anstruther, and Badgerly from Badgworthy.[7]
    <br>One must be cautious to interpret a surname as toponymic based on its spelling alone, without knowing its history. A notable example is the name of Jeanne d'Arc, which is not related to a place called Arc but instead is a distorted patronymic (see "Name of Joan of Arc"). Likewise, it has been suggested that a toponymic cannot be assumed to be a place of residence or origin: merchants could have adopted a toponymic by-name to associate themselves with a place where they never resided.[1]
    <br>In Polish, a toponymic surname may be created by adding "(w)ski" or "cki" at the end. For example, Maliszewski is a toponymic surname associated with one of the places in Poland named Maliszew, Maliszewo, or Maliszów. [8]
    <br>In anthroponymic terminology, toponymic surnames belong among topoanthroponyms (class of anthroponyms that are formed from toponyms).[9]"

    <br>In informal situations, given names are often used in a familiar and friendly manner.[1] In more formal situations, a person's surname is more commonly used—unless a distinction needs to be made between people with the same surname. The idioms 'on a first-name basis' and 'being on first-name terms' refer to the familiarity inherent in addressing someone by their given name.[1]
    <br>By contrast, a surname (also known as a family name, last name, or gentile name), is normally inherited and shared with other members of one's immediate family.[2] Regnal names and religious or monastic names are special given names bestowed upon someone receiving a crown or entering a religious order; such a person then typically becomes known chiefly by that name."

    <br>===
    <br>"An honorific is a title that conveys esteem, courtesy, or respect for position or rank when used in addressing or referring to a person. Sometimes, the term "honorific" is used in a more specific sense to refer to an honorary academic title. It is also often conflated with systems of honorific speech in linguistics, which are grammatical or morphological ways of encoding the relative social status of speakers. Honorifics can be used as prefixes or suffixes depending on the appropriate occasion and presentation in accordance with style and customs.
    <br>Typically, honorifics are used as a style in the grammatical third person, and as a form of address in the second person. Use in the first person, by the honored dignitary, is uncommon or considered very rude and egotistical. Some languages have anti-honorific (despective or humilific) first person forms (expressions such as "your most humble servant" or "this unworthy person") whose effect is to enhance the relative honor accorded to the person addressed."

Last December, lawmakers agreed to do away with the country’s traditional methods of age calculation and bring South Korea in line with the rest of the world.
    <br>Previously, there were two methods of calculating age in South Korea that made it an outlier from other countries. The most widely used was the "Korean age system," which made everyone 1 year old at birth (with the rationale of counting time spent in the womb). And everyone’s birthday was considered to be January 1. For example, a baby born on December 31, 2022 would turn 2 years old on January 1, 2023 under the Korean age system. The other method was the "counting age system" which differed in that babies were considered 0 at birth but still celebrated their birthdays on January 1."

    <br>"Opportunity cost is a fundamental concept in economics and decision-making, which refers to the value of the best alternative forgone when a decision is made to pursue a certain action. In simpler terms, it's the benefit you could have received by taking an alternative action.
    <br>The concept is critical because it underscores the idea of trade-offs. Whenever resources such as time, money, or effort are limited (which they almost always are), choosing one option means you cannot choose another. The opportunity cost of any decision is the value of the next best alternative that you didn't choose.
    <br>For example, if you decide to spend money on a vacation, the opportunity cost might be the things you could have purchased or invested in with that money instead. If you decide to spend the evening watching a movie, the opportunity cost might be the time you could have spent reading, exercising, or working on a project.
    <br>Understanding opportunity costs can help individuals and businesses make more informed decisions by explicitly considering what they are giving up when making a choice. It's a critical concept for budgeting, investing, and prioritizing resources effectively."

    <br>
    <br>"Opportunity cost is basically the idea that whenever you make a choice, you give up something else. It's the value of the next best option that you're missing out on by going with your first choice.
    <br>For example, if you decide to spend tonight studying for an exam, the opportunity cost is all the other things you could be doing with that time, like going to a movie, hanging out with friends, or getting some extra sleep.
    <br>The concept of opportunity cost applies to all sorts of decisions, big and small. It's an important idea to consider whenever you're trying to make a wise choice. By thinking about the opportunity cost of each option, you can weigh the pros and cons more carefully and make a decision that you're happy with."

    <br>"You’re an economics professor. Teach me the concept of game theory in simple terms. What are some real-world examples of how this would be applied? At the very end, include a glossary of concepts/vocabulary that I should know related to this subject.
    <br>Game theory is the study of how rational decision-makers interact with each other in strategic situations. It is used to analyze a wide range of real-world problems, from business competition to international relations.
    <br>In simple terms, game theory is about making the best decision possible, given what you think other people will do.
    <br>A game is a situation in which two or more players make decisions that affect each other's outcomes. The players can be individuals, firms, countries, or any other group of decision-makers.
    <br>Each player has a set of strategies to choose from. A strategy is a complete plan of action that a player will follow, no matter what other players do.
    <br>The outcome of the game depends on the strategies that all of the players choose. The outcome can be measured in terms of payoffs, which can be anything from money to political power to social status.
    <br>One of the most important concepts in game theory is the Nash equilibrium. A Nash equilibrium is a situation in which no player can improve their payoff by changing their strategy, given the strategies of the other players.
    <br>Real-world examples of game theory in action:
    <br>* Pricing decisions: Firms compete with each other by setting prices for their products. Game theory can be used to analyze how these pricing decisions interact with each other. For example, if two firms are selling the same product, they may both lower their prices to attract more customers. However, this can lead to a price war, which can hurt both firms' profits.
    <br>* Collective bargaining: Workers often negotiate with their employers over wages and benefits. Game theory can be used to analyze the strategies that both sides use in these negotiations. For example, workers may threaten to strike if they don't get what they want. Employers may threaten to lay off workers if they can't reach an agreement.
    <br>* New product development: Firms often compete with each other to develop new products. Game theory can be used to analyze the strategies that firms use in this process. For example, a firm may decide to delay launching a new product until after a competitor has launched theirs, so that they can learn from the competitor's mistakes.
    <br>* Auctions: Auctions are another situation where game theory can be applied. Bidders in an auction are trying to win the item being auctioned for the lowest possible price. Game theory can be used to analyze the strategies that bidders use to win auctions. For example, a bidder may try to avoid bidding against each other by coordinating their strategies.
    <br>Glossary of concepts/vocabulary related to game theory:
    <br>* Player: A decision-maker in a game.
    <br>* Strategy: A complete plan of action that a player will follow, no matter what other players do.
    <br>* Payoff: The outcome of a game for a player.
    <br>* Nash equilibrium: A situation in which no player can improve their payoff by changing their strategy, given the strategies of the other players.
    <br>* Zero-sum game: A game in which the total payoffs to all players are constant. In other words, one player's gain must be another player's loss.
    <br>* Non-zero-sum game: A game in which the total payoffs to all players can increase or decrease. In other words, it is possible for both players to win or both players to lose.
    <br>* Cooperative game: A game in which players can communicate and make agreements with each other.
    <br>* Non-cooperative game: A game in which players cannot communicate with each other or make agreements.
    <br>I hope this helps!"

    <br>"A social skill is any competence facilitating interaction and communication with others where social rules and relations are created, communicated, and changed in verbal and nonverbal ways. The process of learning these skills is called socialization. Lack of such skills can cause social awkwardness.
    <br>Interpersonal skills are the acts a person uses to interact with, and relate to, others; they are related to the categories of dominance vs. submission, love vs. hate, affiliation vs. aggression, and control vs. autonomy (Leary, 1957). Positive interpersonal skills include persuasion, active listening, delegation, and stewardship, among others. Social psychology is the academic discipline that does research related to social skills and studies how skills are learned by an individual through changes in attitude, thinking, and behavior.[citation needed]"

In many countries, a résumé is typically the first item that a potential employer encounters regarding the job seeker and is typically used to screen applicants, often followed by an interview. Vitae may also be requested for applicants to postsecondary programs, scholarships, grants and bursaries. In the 2010s it became popular for applicants to provide an electronic text of their CV to employers using email, an online employment website or using a job-oriented social-networking-service website, such as LinkedIn."

    <br>"In industrial and organizational psychology, biodata is biographical data.[1] Biodata is “...factual kinds of questions about life and work experiences, as well as items involving opinions, values, beliefs, and attitudes that reflect a historical perspective.”[2] Since the respondent replies to questions about themselves, there are elements of both biography and autobiography. The basis of biodata's predictive abilities is the axiom that past behaviour is the best predictor of future behaviour.[3] Biographical information is not expected to predict all future behaviours but it is useful in personal selection in that it can give an indication of probable future behaviours based on an individual's prior learning history.[4] Biodata instruments (also called Biographical Information Blanks) have an advantage over personality and interest inventories in that they can capture directly the past behaviour of a person, probably the best predictor of his or her future actions.[citation needed] These measures deal with facts about the person's life, not introspections and subjective judgements.[5]
    <br>Over the years, personnel selection has relied on standardized psychological tests.[6] The five major categories for these tests are intellectual abilities, spatial and mechanical abilities, perceptual accuracy, motor abilities and personality tests. The mean coefficient for a standardized test of g is 0.51.[7] A review of 58 studies on biodata found coefficients that ranged from 0.32 to 0.46 with a mean validity of 0.35. The mean validity of interviews was found to be 0.19. research has indicated a validity coefficient of 0.29 for unstructured interviews and 0.31 for structured interviews but interview results can be affected by interviewer biases and have been challenged in a number of different court cases.[8]
    <br>In summary, biodata has been shown to be a valid and reliable means to predict future performance based on an applicant's past performance. A well-constructed biodata instrument is legally defendable and unlike the interview, is not susceptible to error due to rater biases or the halo effect. It has proven its worth in personnel selection as a cost-effective tool.[9]"

  <p id="idHmnatt168dsn">description::
    <br>"mindset vs worldview
    <br>Mindset and worldview are related concepts, but they are not the same thing. Here's a breakdown of the differences between mindset and worldview:
    <br>* Definition:
    <br>- Mindset: A mindset refers to a person's set of attitudes, beliefs, and assumptions that influence their thinking and behavior. It often relates to specific areas of life, such as learning, resilience, or success. For example, having a growth mindset means believing in the potential for personal development and improvement through effort and learning.
    <br>- Worldview: A worldview is a broader and more comprehensive perspective on the world and reality as a whole. It encompasses a person's fundamental beliefs, values, and principles about the nature of existence, the purpose of life, morality, and the nature of reality itself. A worldview often serves as a foundation for a person's beliefs and decisions across various aspects of life.
    <br>* Scope:
    <br>- Mindset: Mindsets are typically focused on specific areas or aspects of life, such as personal growth, career, relationships, or problem-solving. They can be adapted and changed in response to different situations and challenges.
    <br>- Worldview: A worldview is a comprehensive framework that underlies a person's beliefs and values across a wide range of topics. It tends to be more deeply ingrained and less subject to change than a mindset.
    <br>* Flexibility:
    <br>- Mindset: Mindsets can be flexible and can evolve over time. For example, someone with a fixed mindset in a certain area can develop a growth mindset with effort and awareness.
    <br>- Worldview: Worldviews are typically more rigid and resistant to change. They are often deeply rooted in a person's cultural, religious, or philosophical beliefs and can be challenging to alter.
    <br>* Application:
    <br>- Mindset: Mindsets are often applied to specific challenges or goals in life, helping individuals approach those situations with a particular mindset, such as a problem-solving mindset or an entrepreneurial mindset.
    <br>- Worldview: A worldview serves as a foundation for a person's overall perspective on life and guides their decisions and actions in a more overarching way.
    <br>In summary, while both mindset and worldview are important aspects of a person's cognitive framework, mindset is more focused on specific attitudes and beliefs related to particular areas of life, whereas worldview is a broader and more comprehensive set of beliefs and values that shape a person's fundamental outlook on the world and reality."

    <br>"Human physical appearance is the outward phenotype or look of human beings.
    <br>There are infinite variations in human phenotypes, though society reduces the variability to distinct categories. Physical appearance of humans, in particular those attributes which are regarded as important for physical attractiveness, are believed by anthropologists to significantly affect the development of personality and social relations. Humans are acutely sensitive to their physical appearance.[1] Some differences in human appearance are genetic, others are the result of age, lifestyle or disease, and many are the result of personal adornment.
    <br>Some people have linked some differences, with ethnicity, such as skeletal shape, prognathism or elongated stride. Different cultures place different degrees of emphasis on physical appearance and its importance to social status and other phenomena."

    <br>"Facial symmetry is one specific measure of bodily symmetry. Along with traits such as averageness and youthfulness it influences judgments of aesthetic traits of physical attractiveness and beauty.[1] For instance, in mate selection, people have been shown to have a preference for symmetry.[2][3]
    <br>Facial symmetry has been suggested as a possible physical manifestation of the 'big-five' personality traits.[4]
    <br>Facial bilateral symmetry is typically defined as fluctuating asymmetry of the face comparing random differences in facial features of the two sides of the face.[5] The human face also has systematic, directional asymmetry: on average, the face (mouth, nose and eyes) sits systematically to the left with respect to the axis through the ears, the so-called aurofacial asymmetry.[6]"

    <br>"The flip side of #rights is #responsibility, without taking responsibility for your life and  responsibility for respecting the rights of others you can have no moral claim to rights. Demanding "rights" without taking responsibility is expressing a desire to enslave others."
    <br>[Daniel-Larimer, https://twitter.com/bytemaster7/status/1276139283460521985 {2020-06-25}]
    <br>
    <br>">obligation vs responsibility:
    <br>"Obligation" and "responsibility" are terms often used interchangeably but have slightly different connotations and applications in various contexts.
    <br>**Obligation** typically refers to a duty that is imposed by legal, social, or moral forces. It’s something that one is required to do, often by law or contract. For example, you have an obligation to pay taxes or fulfill the terms of a contract. Obligations are externally imposed and are often associated with a specific action that must be taken, regardless of personal feelings.
    <br>**Responsibility**, on the other hand, can be broader and includes both the duties you are bound to by law or rules and those you accept personally. It often implies accountability and an ethical or moral dimension where the individual recognizes the importance of their role or task. Responsibilities can be voluntarily adopted and involve a sense of ownership over the outcome of one’s actions. For example, a person may feel a responsibility to care for their family or to contribute positively to society.
    <br>In essence, while obligations are duties enforced from outside, responsibilities are often adopted internally and reflect personal values and ethics."

    <br>">law on human-rights:
    <br>Human rights law exists primarily at the international level, though it can be incorporated into domestic law as well. Here's a breakdown:
    <br>**International Human Rights Law**
    <br>* Establishes obligations for governments to:
    <br>    * Respect human rights (not interfering with them)
    <br>    * Protect human rights (from abuse by others)
    <br>    * Fulfill human rights (taking positive actions to ensure them)
    <br>* Key document: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) by the UN [UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights]
    <br>* UDHR outlines fundamental rights like:
    <br>    * Right to life, liberty and security
    <br>    * Freedom from torture and slavery
    <br>    * Right to equality and non-discrimination
    <br>    * Many more!
    <br>**Treaties and Mechanisms**
    <br>* Many international human rights treaties exist, which countries can choose to ratify (become legally bound by).  These treaties address specific rights or groups.
    <br>* The UN also has mechanisms for monitoring human rights compliance and addressing violations.
    <br>**Domestic Law**
    <br>* Many countries incorporate international human rights law into their domestic legal systems.
    <br>* This can be done through constitutions, legislation, or court decisions.
    <br>Overall, human rights law is a vast and complex field, but hopefully, this gives you a basic understanding of its structure.  If you're interested in learning more about a specific aspect, like a particular right or treaty,  let me know!"

    <br>
    <br>"The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) is a multilateral treaty that commits nations to respect the civil and political rights of individuals, including the right to life, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, electoral rights and rights to due process and a fair trial.[3] It was adopted by United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2200A (XXI) on 16 December 1966 and entered into force on 23 March 1976 after its thirty-fifth ratification or accession.[A] As of June 2022, the Covenant has 173 parties and six more signatories without ratification, most notably the People's Republic of China and Cuba;[1] North Korea is the only state that has tried to withdraw.
    <br>The ICCPR is considered a seminal document in the history of international law and human rights, forming part of the International Bill of Human Rights, along with the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).[4]
    <br>Compliance with the ICCPR is monitored by the United Nations Human Rights Committee,[B] which reviews regular reports of states parties on how the rights are being implemented. States must report one year after acceding to the Covenant and then whenever the Committee requests (usually every four years). The Committee normally meets at the UN Office at Geneva, Switzerland and typically holds three sessions per year."

    <br>The Council investigates allegations of breaches of human rights in United Nations member states and addresses thematic human rights issues like freedom of association and assembly,[5] freedom of expression,[6] freedom of belief and religion,[7] women's rights,[8] LGBT rights,[9] and the rights of racial and ethnic minorities.[b]
    <br>The Council was established by the United Nations General Assembly on 15 March 2006[c] to replace the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR, herein CHR).[10] The Council works closely with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and engages the United Nations special procedures. The Council has been strongly criticized for including member countries that engage in human rights abuses.[11][12]"

    <br>"The United Nations Human Rights Committee is a treaty body composed of 18 experts, established by a 1966 human rights treaty, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The Committee meets for three four-week sessions per year to consider the periodic reports submitted by the 173 States parties to the ICCPR on their compliance with the treaty, and any individual petitions concerning the 116 States parties to the ICCPR's First Optional Protocol.[1] The Committee is one of ten UN human rights treaty bodies, each responsible for overseeing the implementation of a particular treaty.[2]
    <br>The UN Human Rights Committee should not be confused with the more high-profile UN Human Rights Council (HRC), or the predecessor of the HRC, the UN Commission on Human Rights. Whereas the Human Rights Council (since June 2006) and the Commission on Human Rights (before that date) are UN political bodies: composed of states, established by a UN General Assembly resolution and the UN Charter, and discussing the entire range of human rights concerns; the Human Rights Committee is a UN expert body: composed of persons, established by the ICCPR, and discussing matters pertaining only to that treaty. The Human Rights Committee is often referred to as CCPR (Committee on Civil and Political Rights) in order to avoid that confusion.[3][4]"

    <br>"The Human Rights Measurement Initiative (HRMI) is a non-profit organization based in Wellington, New Zealand, focused on tracking the human rights performance of countries worldwide. Founded in 2016 by Anne-Marie Brook, K. Chad Clay, and Susan Randolph, HRMI aims to address the lack of accessible and understandable human rights data. They provide a freely accessible database that summarizes how countries respect and protect various human rights, advocating that better metrics can drive improvements globally【https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Measurement_Initiative】.
    <br>HRMI uses a dual approach to measure human rights. For civil and political rights, it collects data through a peer-reviewed, multilingual survey of human rights experts. This method aims to capture real-time and accurate assessments of human rights conditions directly from those monitoring them in various countries. On the other hand, HRMI's measures of economic and social rights are derived from the Social and Economic Rights Fulfillment (SERF) Index. This index uses publicly available data to assess rights fulfillment based on factors like infant mortality and school enrollment【https://humanrightsmeasurement.org/methodology/】【https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Measurement_Initiative】.
    <br>The initiative categorizes human rights into three groups: Quality of Life Rights, Safety from the State Rights, and Empowerment Rights, covering a total of 13 rights as per the latest data. These measurements are accessible via the Rights Tracker, a tool on HRMI's website designed to provide easily navigable data for advocacy, research, and policy-making【https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Measurement_Initiative】.
    <br>HRMI emphasizes the importance of rigorous data collection and strives for transparency and collaboration in its methodology, engaging with experts and academics to refine their metrics and ensure they are both useful and accurate【https://humanrightsmeasurement.org/what-we-do/】. This approach has garnered attention and use in various sectors, including media, academia, and non-governmental organizations, underscoring the broader impact and utility of HRMI's work in promoting human rights globally【https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Measurement_Initiative】."

    <br>">types of human rights:
    <br>There are two main ways that human rights are typically categorized:
    <br>* **Generations of Rights** - This framework divides human rights into three categories, based on the historical order in which they were recognized.
    <br>  * **First Generation Rights (Civil and Political Rights)**: These rights are about protecting individuals from the state. They were the first to be recognized internationally and include:
    <br>      * Right to life
    <br>      * Right to freedom from torture
    <br>      * Right to freedom of expression
    <br>      * Right to a fair trial
    <br>  * **Second Generation Rights (Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights)**: These rights focus on people's economic and social well-being. They were recognized after the first generation rights and include:
    <br>      * Right to work
    <br>      * Right to social security
    <br>      * Right to education
    <br>      * Right to health
    <br>  * **Third Generation Rights (Solidarity Rights)**: These rights are about international cooperation and the responsibility of states to address global problems. They are the most recent to be recognized and include:
    <br>      * Right to development
    <br>      * Right to peace
    <br>      * Right to a clean environment
    <br>
    <br>* **Types of Rights** - This framework divides human rights into five categories, based on the nature of the right.
    <br>  * **Civil Rights** - These rights protect individuals from interference by the government, such as the right to life, liberty, and security of person.
    <br>  * **Political Rights** - These rights allow individuals to participate in the political process, such as the right to vote and hold office.
    <br>  * **Economic Rights** - These rights ensure that everyone has the opportunity to earn a living and enjoy a decent standard of living, such as the right to work and the right to social security.
    <br>  * **Social Rights** - These rights guarantee basic necessities of life, such as the right to education and the right to health.
    <br>  * **Cultural Rights** - These rights allow individuals to express their cultural identity, such as the right to freedom of religion and the right to freedom of expression.
    <br>It's important to remember that all human rights are interconnected and interdependent. For example, you cannot fully exercise your right to freedom of expression if you are not also guaranteed the right to education."

  <p id="idHmnatt032dsn">description::
    <br>"Discrimination is the act of making distinctions between human beings based on the groups, classes, or other categories to which they are perceived to belong. People may discriminate on the basis of age, caste, criminal record, height, weight, physical appearance, disability, family status, gender identity, gender expression, generation, genetic characteristics, marital status, nationality, Profession, color, race and ethnicity, religion, sex and sex characteristics, sexual orientation, political ideology, social class, personality, as well as other categories. Discrimination occurs when individuals or groups are treated "in a way which is worse than the way people are usually treated," on the basis of their actual or perceived membership in certain groups or social categories.[1] It involves the group's initial reaction or interaction going on to influence the individual's actual behavior towards the group's leader or the group, restricting members of one group from opportunities or privileges that are available to members of another group, leading to the exclusion of the individual or entities based on illogical or irrational decision making.[2]
    <br>Discriminatory traditions, policies, ideas, practices and laws exist in many countries and institutions in all parts of the world, including territories where discrimination is generally looked down upon. In some places, attempts such as quotas have been used to benefit those who are believed to be current or past victims of discrimination. These attempts have often been met with controversy, and have sometimes been called reverse discrimination."

    <br>">ετυμολογία "οικογένεια":
    <br>Η ετυμολογία της λέξης "οικογένεια" προέρχεται από το αρχαίο ελληνικό. Η λέξη αποτελείται από δύο μέρη: το πρόθεμα "οἶκος" (οἶκος), που σημαίνει "σπίτι" ή "σπιτικό", και την κατάληξη "-γένεια" που προέρχεται από την ρίζα "γεν-" (γεννάω), που σημαίνει "γεννώ", "δημιουργώ" ή "φέρω στη ζωή". Έτσι, η λέξη "οικογένεια" μπορεί να ερμηνευτεί ως "οι άνθρωποι που γεννιούνται ή αναπτύσσονται στο ίδιο σπίτι" ή "η μονάδα των ανθρώπων που ζουν μαζί σε ένα σπίτι και συνδέονται με γενεαλογικούς δεσμούς".
    <br>Η έννοια της οικογένειας έχει εξελιχθεί σημαντικά μέσα στους αιώνες, αλλά η βασική ιδέα της σύνδεσης των ανθρώπων μέσω της κοινής κατοικίας και των γενεαλογικών δεσμών παραμένει κεντρική στην έννοια της λέξης."

    <br>
    <br>">etymology of "family":
    <br>The etymology of the word "family" traces back to the Latin term "familia," which originally meant the household servants or a household (including both servants and relatives) under one head of the house. This Latin term is derived from "famulus," meaning servant or slave. Over time, the meaning of "familia" expanded to include not just the household servants but also the more comprehensive unit of parents, children, and extended kin.
    <br>The transition from "familia" as a term referring to servants and household members to its contemporary meaning, emphasizing the biological and emotional bonds between parents and their children, reflects broader changes in social structures and attitudes towards kinship and domestic life.
    <br>In English, "family" began to be used in the 15th century, and its meaning has continued to evolve. Today, it encompasses a wide range of relationships and structures, including nuclear families (parents and their children), extended families (including grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins), and chosen families (groups of individuals who intentionally commit to support each other in the ways typical of a family).
    <br>The evolution of the word "family" from its origins in servant-master relationships to its current connotations of kinship, care, and connectedness illustrates the dynamic nature of language and how it reflects changing societal values and norms."

    <br>">surrogate mother:
    <br>A surrogate mother is a woman who agrees to carry and give birth to a child for another person or couple, who will become the child's parent(s) after birth. There are two main types of surrogacy: traditional surrogacy and gestational surrogacy.
    <br>- **Traditional Surrogacy:** In traditional surrogacy, the surrogate mother is also the biological mother of the child. Her own egg is fertilized, typically through artificial insemination, using the sperm of the intended father or a sperm donor. Because the surrogate mother is the child's biological mother, traditional surrogacy raises various legal and emotional issues.
    <br>- **Gestational Surrogacy:** In gestational surrogacy, the surrogate mother has no genetic link to the child she carries. The embryo is created via in vitro fertilization (IVF) using the egg and sperm of the intended parents or donors, and then transferred to the surrogate's uterus. Gestational surrogacy has become more common than traditional surrogacy because it allows both intended parents to be genetically related to the child, and it reduces legal and emotional complexities related to the surrogate's biological connection to the child.
    <br>Surrogacy involves complex emotional, ethical, and legal considerations. Legal regulations vary significantly by country and even by regions within countries, ranging from complete bans to strict regulations or full legality. Intended parents and surrogates typically engage in a legal process to ensure that parental rights are properly transferred from the surrogate to the intended parents.
    <br>The reasons for seeking surrogacy include infertility, medical conditions that make pregnancy or delivery risky, and personal choice or circumstance, such as for single individuals or same-sex couples wishing to have children. Surrogacy can be a deeply fulfilling experience for all involved but also requires careful consideration of the ethical, psychological, and legal implications."

    <br>">family types:
    <br>Family types are the different ways that families are structured. There are many different family types, but some of the most common include:
    <br>* **Nuclear family:** This is the traditional family type, which consists of two parents and their children.
    <br>* **Single-parent family:** This type of family consists of one parent and their children.
    <br>* **Extended family:** This type of family includes multiple generations living together, such as parents, children, grandparents, and aunts and uncles.
    <br>* **Stepfamily:** This type of family is formed when one or both parents remarry and bring children from previous relationships into the new family.
    <br>* **Grandparent family:** This type of family consists of grandparents and their grandchildren.
    <br>* **Same-sex couple family:** This type of family consists of two same-sex parents and their children.
    <br>* **Foster family:** This type of family provides temporary care for children who cannot live with their own parents.
    <br>* **Adoptive family:** This type of family is formed when a child is raised by parents who are not their biological parents.
    <br>
    <br>The type of family that a person grows up in can have a significant impact on their life. For example, children who grow up in nuclear families tend to have better outcomes in terms of education, employment, and health than children who grow up in other family types. However, it is important to remember that every family is different, and there is no one "right" way to raise a child.
    <br>
    <br>No matter what type of family a person comes from, family is an important part of life. Families can provide love, support, and a sense of belonging. They can also teach children important values and life skills."

    <br>"Personality is defined as the characteristic sets of behaviors, cognitions, and emotional patterns that evolve from biological and environmental factors.[1] While there is no generally agreed upon definition of personality, most theories focus on motivation and psychological interactions with one's environment.[2] Trait-based personality theories, such as those defined by Raymond Cattell, define personality as the traits that predict a person's behavior. On the other hand, more behaviorally-based approaches define personality through learning and habits. Nevertheless, most theories view personality as relatively stable.[1]
    <br>The study of the psychology of personality, called personality psychology, attempts to explain the tendencies that underlie differences in behavior. Many approaches have been taken on to study personality, including biological, cognitive, learning and trait-based theories, as well as psychodynamic, and humanistic approaches. Personality psychology is divided among the first theorists, with a few influential theories being posited by Sigmund Freud, Alfred Adler, Gordon Allport, Hans Eysenck, Abraham Maslow, and Carl Rogers."

  <p id="idHmnatt132dsn">description::
    <br>"The Big Five personality traits, also known as the OCEAN model, is a suggested taxonomy, or grouping, for personality traits,[1] developed from the 1980s onwards in psychological trait theory. When factor analysis (a statistical technique) is applied to personality survey data, it reveals semantic associations: some words used to describe aspects of personality are often applied to the same person. For example, someone described as conscientious is more likely to be described as "always prepared" rather than "messy". These associations suggest five broad dimensions used in common language to describe the human personality and psyche.[2][3]
    <br>The theory identifies five factors:
    <br>* openness to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)
    <br>* conscientiousness (efficient/organized vs. extravagant/careless)
    <br>* extraversion (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)
    <br>* agreeableness (friendly/compassionate vs. challenging/callous)
    <br>* neuroticism (sensitive/nervous vs. resilient/confident)[4]
    <br>The five factors are abbreviated in the acronyms OCEAN or CANOE. Beneath each proposed global factor, there are a number of correlated and more specific primary factors. Extraversion is typically associated with qualities such as gregariousness, assertiveness, excitement-seeking, warmth, activity, and positive emotions.[5] These traits are not black and white, but rather placed on continuums.[6]
    <br>Family life and upbringing will affect these traits. Twin studies and other research have shown that about half of the variation between individuals results from their genetic inheritance and half from their environment. Researchers have found conscientiousness, extraversion, openness to experience, and neuroticism to be relatively stable from childhood through adulthood.[7]"

  <p id="idHmnatt133dsn">description::
    <br>"Openness to experience is one of the domains which are used to describe human personality in the Five Factor Model.[1][2] Openness involves six facets, or dimensions, including active imagination (fantasy), aesthetic sensitivity, attentiveness to inner feelings, preference for variety, and intellectual curiosity.[3] A great deal of psychometric research has demonstrated that these facets or qualities are significantly correlated.[2] Thus, openness can be viewed as a global personality trait consisting of a set of specific traits, habits, and tendencies that cluster together.
    <br>Openness tends to be normally distributed with a small number of individuals scoring extremely high or low on the trait, and most people scoring moderately.[2] People who score low on openness are considered to be closed to experience. They tend to be conventional and traditional in their outlook and behavior. They prefer familiar routines to new experiences, and generally have a narrower range of interests. Openness has moderate positive relationships with creativity, intelligence and knowledge. Openness is related to the psychological trait of absorption, and like absorption has a modest relationship to individual differences in hypnotic susceptibility.
    <br>Openness has more modest relationships with aspects of subjective well-being than other Five Factor Model personality traits.[4] On the whole, openness appears to be largely unrelated to symptoms of mental disorders.[5]"

  <p id="idHmnatt016dsn">description::
    <br>"Conscientiousness is the personality trait of being careful, or diligent. Conscientiousness implies a desire to do a task well, and to take obligations to others seriously. Conscientious people tend to be efficient and organized as opposed to easy-going and disorderly. They exhibit a tendency to show self-discipline, act dutifully, and aim for achievement; they display planned rather than spontaneous behavior; and they are generally dependable. It is manifested in characteristic behaviors such as being neat, and systematic; also including such elements as carefulness, thoroughness, and deliberation (the tendency to think carefully before acting).[1]
    <br>Conscientiousness is one of the five traits of both the Five Factor Model and the HEXACO model of personality and is an aspect of what has traditionally been referred to as having character. Conscientious individuals are generally hard-working, and reliable. They are also likely to be conformists.[2] When taken to an extreme, they may also be "workaholics", perfectionists, and compulsive in their behavior.[3] People who score low on conscientiousness tend to be laid back, less goal-oriented, and less driven by success; they also are more likely to engage in antisocial and criminal behavior.[4]"

  <p id="idHmnatt135dsn">description::
    <br>"The traits of extraversion (or extroversion) and introversion are a central dimension in some human personality theories. The terms introversion and extraversion were popularized by Carl Jung,[1] although both the popular understanding and psychological usage differ from his original intent. Extraversion tends to be manifested in outgoing, talkative, energetic behavior, whereas introversion is manifested in more reserved and solitary behavior.[2] Rather than focusing on interpersonal behavior, however, Jung defined introversion as an "attitude-type characterised by orientation in life through subjective psychic contents", and extraversion as "an attitude-type characterised by concentration of interest on the external object".[3]
    <br>Extraversion and introversion are typically viewed as a single continuum, so to be high in one necessitates being low in the other. Jung provides a different perspective and suggests that everyone has both an extraverted side and an introverted side, with one being more dominant than the other. Virtually all comprehensive models of personality include these concepts in various forms. Examples include the Big Five model, Jung's analytical psychology, Hans Eysenck's three-factor model, Raymond Cattell's 16 personality factors, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, and the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator."

    <br>"Agreeableness is a personality trait manifesting itself in individual behavioral characteristics that are perceived as kind, sympathetic, cooperative, warm, and considerate.[1] In contemporary personality psychology, agreeableness is one of the five major dimensions of personality structure, reflecting individual differences in cooperation and social harmony.[2]
    <br>People who score high on this dimension are empathetic and altruistic, while a low agreeableness score relates to selfish behavior and a lack of empathy.[3][4] Those who score very low on agreeableness show signs of dark triad behavior such as manipulation and competing with others rather than cooperating.[5]
    <br>Agreeableness is considered to be a superordinate trait, meaning that it is a grouping of personality sub-traits that cluster together statistically. The lower-level traits, or facets, grouped under agreeableness are: trust, straightforwardness, altruism, compliance, modesty, and tender-mindedness.[6]"

They are often self-conscious and shy, and they may have trouble controlling urges and delaying gratification.
    <br>Persons with a high neuroticism index are at risk for the development and onset of common mental disorders,[2][3] such as mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorder, symptoms which had traditionally been called neuroses.[3][4]"

    <br>"Altruism is the principle and moral practice of concern for happiness of other human beings or animals, resulting in a quality of life both material and spiritual. It is a traditional virtue in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions and secular worldviews, though the concept of "others" toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions. In an extreme case, altruism may become a synonym of selflessness, which is the opposite of selfishness.
    <br>The word "altruism" was coined by the French philosopher Auguste Comte in French, as altruisme, for an antonym of egoism.[1][2] He derived it from the Italian altrui, which in turn was derived from Latin alteri, meaning "other people" or "somebody else".[3]"

    <br>"behavior vs action
    <br>The terms "behavior" and "action" are often used interchangeably, but there is a subtle difference between the two.
    <br>Behavior is a broader term that refers to all the ways in which an organism or system interacts with its environment. This includes both observable actions, such as speaking or moving, and internal states, such as thoughts, feelings, and memories.
    <br>Action is a more specific term that refers to a single, intentional act. Actions are typically motivated by a goal or purpose, and they are often directed towards other people or objects.
    <br>For example, a person's "behavior" might include talking to their friends, eating a meal, and taking a walk. Each of these actions is made up of smaller, observable behaviors, such as moving the lips, chewing food, and lifting the legs. However, the act of "talking to friends" is a more specific action that is motivated by the goal of social interaction.
    <br>In sociology, the term "social action" is used to refer to actions that are oriented towards the behavior of others. This means that social actions are intentional and take into account the reactions of others. For example, a person who raises their hand in class is engaging in a social action because they are intentionally trying to get the attention of the teacher.
    <br>Here is a table that summarizes the key differences between behavior and action:
    <br>Feature | Behavior | Action
    <br>* Definition | All the ways in which an organism or system interacts with its environment | A single, intentional act
    <br>* Scope | Broad | Narrow
    <br>* Includes | Observable actions and internal states | Observable actions
    <br>* Motivation | Varies | Goal-oriented
    <br>* Orientation | Not necessarily oriented towards others | Oriented towards others (in sociology)
    <br>I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."
    <br>[{2023-09-13 retrieved} https://bard.google.com/]
    <br>===
    <br>"Behavior and action are related terms but they have slightly different meanings.
    <br>Behavior refers to the way in which a person or animal acts or conducts themselves in response to a particular situation. It encompasses a wide range of observable and measurable activities, including thoughts, feelings, and physical movements.
    <br>Action, on the other hand, refers specifically to the act of doing something. It is often used to describe a deliberate, purposeful behavior that has a specific goal or intention behind it.
    <br>In other words, behavior is a broader concept that includes all of the ways in which a person or animal interacts with their environment, while action refers to a specific behavior that is undertaken with a particular intention or goal in mind.
    <br>For example, if someone is exhibiting aggressive behavior, this could manifest in a variety of ways, such as yelling, hitting, or throwing objects. However, if they take a specific action, such as physically attacking someone, this would be a more narrowly defined behavior that is undertaken with a specific intention or goal in mind."

  <p id="idHmnatt056dsn">description::
    <br>"In psychology, temperament broadly refers to consistent individual differences in behavior that are biologically based and are relatively independent of learning, system of values and attitudes. Some researchers point to association of temperament with formal dynamical features of behavior, such as energetic aspects, plasticity, sensitivity to specific reinforcers and emotionality.[1] Temperament traits (such as Neuroticism, Sociability, Impulsivity, etc.) are distinct patterns in behavior throughout a lifetime, but they are most noticeable and most studied in children. Babies are typically described by temperament, but longitudinal research in the 1920s began to establish temperament as something which is stable across the lifespan.[2]
    <br>Although a broad definition of temperament is agreed upon, many classification schemes for temperament have been developed, and there is no consensus.[3][4]
    <br>Historically, the concept of temperament (temperamentum in Latin means 'mixture') was a part of the theory of the four humors, with their corresponding four temperaments.
    <br>This historical concept was explored by philosophers, psychologists, psychiatrists and psycho-physiologists from very early times of psychological science, with theories proposed by Immanuel Kant, Hermann Lotze, Ivan Pavlov, Carl Jung, Gerardus Heymans among others.
    <br>More recently, scientists seeking evidence of a biological basis of personality have further examined the relationship between temperament and neurotransmitter systems[5][4][6][7] and character (defined in this context as developmental aspects of personality). However, biological correlations have proven hard to confirm.[8]"

    <br>In most cultures, it is socially disapproved for a person to make explicit sexual advances in public, or in private to someone not romantically acquainted, but indirect or suggestive advances may at times be considered acceptable.[citation needed]"

    <br>"Bullying is the use of force, coercion, or threat, to abuse, aggressively dominate or intimidate. The behavior is often repeated and habitual. One essential prerequisite is the perception (by the bully or by others) of an imbalance of physical or social power. This imbalance distinguishes bullying from conflict.[1] Bullying is a subcategory of aggressive behavior characterized by the following three minimum criteria: (1) hostile intent, (2) imbalance of power, and (3) repetition over a period of time.[2] Bullying is the activity of repeated, aggressive behavior intended to hurt another individual, physically, mentally, or emotionally.
    <br>Bullying ranges from one-on-one, individual bullying through to group bullying, called mobbing, in which the bully may have one or more "lieutenants" who are willing to assist the primary bully in their bullying activities. Bullying in school and the workplace is also referred to as "peer abuse".[3] Robert W. Fuller has analyzed bullying in the context of rankism. The Swedish-Norwegian researcher Dan Olweus says bullying occurs when a person is "exposed, repeatedly and over time, to negative actions on the part of one or more other persons",[4] and that negative actions occur "when a person intentionally inflicts injury or discomfort upon another person, through physical contact, through words or in other ways".[4] Individual bullying is usually characterized by a person behaving in a certain way to gain power over another person.[5]
    <br>A bullying culture can develop in any context in which humans interact with each other. This may include school, family, the workplace,[6] the home, and neighborhoods. The main platform for bullying in contemporary culture is on social media websites.[7] In a 2012 study of male adolescent American football players, "the strongest predictor [of bullying] was the perception of whether the most influential male in a player's life would approve of the bullying behavior."[8]
    <br>Bullying may be defined in many different ways. In the United Kingdom, there is no legal definition of bullying,[9] while some states in the United States have laws against it.[10] Bullying is divided into four basic types of abuse – psychological (sometimes called emotional or relational), verbal, physical, and cyber.[11]
    <br>Behaviors used to assert such domination may include physical assault or coercion, verbal harassment, or threat, and such acts may be directed repeatedly toward particular targets. Rationalizations of such behavior sometimes include differences of social class, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, appearance, behavior, body language, personality, reputation, lineage, strength, size, or ability.[12][13][14] If bullying is done by a group, it is called mobbing.[15]"

    <br>Does Bullying End after High School?
    <br>Research shows that "unattractive" people face bullying at work, along with fewer promotions and more menial tasks.
    <br>For some people, the childish cruelty often associated with high school cliques never really goes away. Research published in the journal Human Performance found that these juvenile mindsets, where attractive students are considered popular and unattractive kids are demeaned and bullied, often carries over into the workplace.

    <br>"Pyrotechnology is a key element of hominin evolution. The identification of fire in early hominin sites relies primarily on an initial visual assessment of artifacts’ physical alterations, resulting in potential underestimation of the prevalence of fire in the archaeological record. Here, we used a suite of spectroscopic techniques to counter the absence of visual signatures for fire and demonstrate the presence of burnt fauna and lithics at the Lower Paleolithic (LP) open-air site of Evron Quarry (Israel), dated between 1.0 and 0.8 Mya and roughly contemporaneous to Gesher Benot Ya’aqov where early pyrotechnology has been documented. We propose reexamining finds from other LP sites lacking visual clues of pyrotechnology to yield a renewed perspective on the origin, evolution, and spatiotemporal dispersal of the relationship between early hominin behavior and fire use."

  <p id="idHmnatt022dsn">description::
    <br>"Biologically, a child (plural children) is a human being between the stages of birth and puberty,[1][2] or between the developmental period of infancy and puberty.[3] The legal definition of child generally refers to a minor, otherwise known as a person younger than the age of majority.[1] Children generally have fewer rights and less responsibility than adults. They are classed as unable to make serious decisions, and legally must be under the care of their parents or another responsible caregiver.
    <br>Child may also describe a relationship with a parent (such as sons and daughters of any age)[4] or, metaphorically, an authority figure, or signify group membership in a clan, tribe, or religion; it can also signify being strongly affected by a specific time, place, or circumstance, as in "a child of nature" or "a child of the Sixties".[5]"
    <br>[{2020-05-03} https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child]
    <br>===
    <br>"In law, a minor is a person under a certain age, usually the age of majority, which legally demarcates childhood from adulthood. The age of majority depends upon jurisdiction and application, but it is generally 18. Minor may also be used in contexts that are unconnected to the overall age of majority. For example, the drinking age in the United States is usually 21, and younger people are sometimes called minors in the context of alcohol law, even if they are at least 18.[1][2] The term underage often refers to those under the age of majority, but it may also refer to persons under a certain age limit, such as the drinking age, smoking age, age of consent, marriageable age, driving age, voting age, etc. Such age limits are often different from the age of majority.
    <br>The concept of minor is not sharply defined in most jurisdictions. The age of criminal responsibility and consent, the age at which school attendance is no longer compulsory, the age at which legally binding contracts can be entered into, and so on may be different from one another.
    <br>In many countries, including Australia, India, Brazil, Croatia, and Colombia, a minor is defined as a person under the age of 18. In the United States, where the age of majority is set by the individual states, minor usually refers to someone under the age of 18 but can, in some states, be used in certain areas (such as casino gambling, handgun ownership and the consuming of alcohol) to define someone under the age of 21. In the criminal justice system in some places, "minor" is not entirely consistent, as a minor may be tried and punished for a crime either as a "juvenile" or, usually only for "extremely serious crimes" such as murder and/or theft, as an "adult".
    <br>In Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand, a minor is a person under 20 years of age. In New Zealand law, the age of majority is 20 years of age as well,[3] but most of the rights of adulthood are assumed at lower ages: for example, entering contracts and having a will are allowed at 15.[4]"

    <br>"Biologically, an adult is an organism that has reached sexual maturity. In human context, the term adult additionally has meanings associated with social and legal concepts. In contrast to a "minor", a legal adult is a person who has attained the age of majority and is therefore regarded as independent, self-sufficient, and responsible. The typical age of attaining legal adulthood is 18, although definition may vary by legal rights and country.
    <br>Human adulthood encompasses psychological adult development. Definitions of adulthood are often inconsistent and contradictory; a person may be biologically an adult, and have adult behavior but still be treated as a child if they are under the legal age of majority. Conversely, one may legally be an adult but possess none of the maturity and responsibility that may define an adult character.
    <br>In different cultures there are events that relate passing from being a child to becoming an adult or coming of age. This often encompasses the passing a series of tests to demonstrate that a person is prepared for adulthood, or reaching a specified age, sometimes in conjunction with demonstrating preparation. Most modern societies determine legal adulthood based on reaching a legally specified age without requiring a demonstration of physical maturity or preparation for adulthood."

    <br>"overview of genus homo:
    <br>The genus Homo is a group of hominins that includes modern humans and our immediate ancestors. The earliest known members of the genus Homo lived in Africa around 2.8 million years ago. Homo sapiens, the only surviving species of the genus, emerged in Africa around 300,000 years ago and spread to all parts of the world by about 100,000 years ago.
    <br>
    <br>Homo is distinguished from other hominin genera by a number of features, including:
    <br>* Larger brains: Homo species have brains that are significantly larger than those of other hominins. This is thought to be due to the development of complex cognitive abilities, such as language and abstract thought.
    <br>* Smaller faces: Homo species have smaller faces and teeth than other hominins. This is thought to be due to a change in diet, from chewing tough plant material to eating softer, more processed foods.
    <br>* Bipedalism: Homo species are obligate bipedal, meaning that they walk upright on two legs. This is thought to have freed up their hands for other tasks, such as tool use.
    <br>
    <br>The genus Homo has a long and complex evolutionary history. Over the past 2.8 million years, Homo species have adapted to a wide range of environments, from the savannas of Africa to the Arctic Circle. They have developed complex cultures and technologies, and have become the dominant species on Earth.
    <br>
    <br>The genus Homo is divided into a number of different species, including:
    <br>* Homo habilis: Homo habilis is the earliest known member of the genus Homo. It lived in Africa around 2.8 to 1.6 million years ago. Homo habilis was a small-bodied hominin with a brain that was larger than that of earlier hominins. It is thought to have been a tool user, and may have been the first hominin to make stone tools.
    <br>* Homo erectus: Homo erectus is a more advanced member of the genus Homo. It lived in Africa, Asia, and Europe around 1.9 million to 140,000 years ago. Homo erectus was larger-bodied than Homo habilis and had a larger brain. It is thought to have been a skilled tool user and hunter-gatherer.
    <br>* Homo ergaster: Homo ergaster is a species of Homo that is closely related to Homo erectus. It lived in Africa around 1.9 million to 1.4 million years ago. Homo ergaster is thought to have been the first hominin to leave Africa and colonize other continents.
    <br>* Homo neanderthalensis: Homo neanderthalensis is a species of Homo that lived in Europe and Asia around 400,000 to 40,000 years ago. Neanderthals were similar to Homo sapiens in many ways, but they had a number of distinctive features, such as a larger brain and a more robust build. Neanderthals were skilled tool users and hunters. They also had complex cultures, including evidence of art and religion.
    <br>* Homo sapiens: Homo sapiens is the only surviving species of the genus Homo. It emerged in Africa around 300,000 years ago and spread to all parts of the world by about 100,000 years ago. Homo sapiens is distinguished from other hominin species by its large brain, small face, and bipedal stance. Homo sapiens is also the only hominin species that has developed complex cultures and technologies.
    <br>
    <br>The genus Homo has played a significant role in the history of life on Earth. Homo species have been responsible for many of the major advances in human evolution, including the development of language, tools, and complex cultures. Homo sapiens is the only surviving species of the genus Homo, but the legacy of our ancestors continues to shape the world today."

    <br>"overview of homo-heidelbergensis
    <br>Homo heidelbergensis is an extinct species of the genus Homo that lived in Europe, Africa, and Asia between 700,000 and 300,000 years ago. It is one of the most important early hominin species, as it is thought to be the ancestor of both Neanderthals and modern humans.
    <br>
    <br>H. heidelbergensis was a physically robust species, with a large brain and a heavy brow ridge. It was also the first hominin species to consistently produce Acheulean stone tools, which are characterized by their symmetry and bifacial design. Acheulean tools were used for a variety of tasks, including hunting, butchering, and woodworking.
    <br>
    <br>H. heidelbergensis was also the first hominin species to occupy a wide range of habitats, from temperate forests to open grasslands. This suggests that it was a highly adaptable species.
    <br>
    <br>H. heidelbergensis is thought to have evolved from Homo erectus, an earlier hominin species that lived in Africa and Asia. H. heidelbergensis then gave rise to both Neanderthals and modern humans. Neanderthals evolved in Europe, while modern humans evolved in Africa.
    <br>
    <br>H. heidelbergensis is an important species in human evolution because it is the ancestor of both Neanderthals and modern humans. It is also the first hominin species to consistently produce Acheulean stone tools and to occupy a wide range of habitats.
    <br>
    <br>Here are some of the key features of Homo heidelbergensis:
    <br>* Large brain (similar in size to modern humans)
    <br>* Heavy brow ridge
    <br>* Acheulean stone tools
    <br>* Wide range of habitats (temperate forests to open grasslands)
    <br>* Ancestor of both Neanderthals and modern humans
    <br>
    <br>H. heidelbergensis is a fascinating species that played an important role in human evolution. By studying H. heidelbergensis, we can learn more about the origins of our own species."

    <br>">human generation:
    <br>A human generation typically refers to all of the people born and living at about the same time, usually within a span of around 20-30 years. Each generation is often viewed as having shared experiences and characteristics shaped by the major events and cultural trends of their formative years.
    <br>Currently, there are several widely recognized human generations:
    <br>* **The Greatest Generation (born 1901-1927):** Also known as the G.I. Generation, they lived through the Great Depression and World War II.
    <br>* **The Silent Generation (born 1928-1945):** They grew up during a time of economic prosperity and conformity following World War II.
    <br>* **Baby Boomers (born 1946-1964):** This large generation is associated with social change, the civil rights movement, and the Vietnam War.
    <br>* **Generation X (born 1965-1980):** Often characterized as independent and self-reliant, they came of age during the rise of personal computers and the end of the Cold War.
    <br>* **Millennials (born 1981-2000):** Also known as Generation Y, they are the first generation to come of age in the new millennium and are comfortable with digital technology.
    <br>* **Generation Z (born 1997-2012):** The youngest generation, they are true digital natives who have grown up with smartphones and social media.
    <br>* **Generation Alpha (born 2013-2025):** This emerging generation is still very young, but they are expected to be even more technologically savvy and globally connected than Gen Z.
    <br>It's important to remember that these generational labels are broad generalizations and not everyone within a generation will share the same experiences or characteristics. However, they can be a useful way to understand how different groups of people may view the world and how their experiences have shaped their values and beliefs."

    <br>"Gen Z, or Generation Z, is the demographic cohort succeeding Millennials and preceding Generation Alpha. There is some debate about the exact birth year range, but it is generally defined as those born between the mid-to-late 1990s and the early 2010s.
    <br>**Key characteristics and traits associated with Gen Z include:**
    <br>* **Digital Natives:** Gen Z is the first generation to have grown up with widespread access to the internet and portable digital technology from a young age. They are highly comfortable with technology and social media and use it extensively for communication, entertainment, and information.
    <br>* **Diversity and Inclusion:** Gen Z is the most racially and ethnically diverse generation in history. They tend to be more accepting of different cultures, identities, and lifestyles.
    <br>* **Social and Environmental Awareness:** Gen Z is more likely than previous generations to be concerned about social and environmental issues, such as climate change, racial injustice, and LGBTQ+ rights. They are also more likely to take action on these issues, through activism, volunteering, and conscious consumerism.
    <br>* **Independent and Entrepreneurial:** Gen Z is often characterized as independent and entrepreneurial. They are more likely to value flexibility and autonomy in their work and are more open to alternative career paths, such as freelancing or starting their own businesses.
    <br>* **Mental Health Awareness:** Gen Z is more open to discussing mental health than previous generations. They are also more likely to seek help for mental health issues.
    <br>It's important to note that these are generalizations, and not every member of Gen Z will fit all of these characteristics. However, they provide a general overview of some of the key trends and traits associated with this generation."

    <br>
    <br>"Generation Z, often shortened to Gen Z, refers to individuals born between the mid-to-late 1990s and the early 2010s, with sources commonly citing 1997 as the starting birth year and 2012 as the ending birth year. Here are some key characteristics and trends associated with Gen Z based on discussions and data:
    <br>1. **Digital Natives**: Gen Z is the first generation to grow up entirely in the digital age, with the internet, social media, and smartphones being an integral part of their daily life from a young age. This has shaped their behavior, how they communicate, consume media, and interact with the world.
    <br>2. **Diversity and Inclusivity**: They are the most diverse generation in terms of ethnicity and are generally more accepting of differences in race, sexuality, and gender identity. This is reflected in discussions around identity politics where Gen Z shows more progressive stances compared to older generations.
    <br>3. **Mental Health Awareness**: There's a notable trend of Gen Z experiencing and discussing mental health issues more openly than previous generations. However, this openness also comes with reports of higher rates of mental health problems.
    <br>4. **Economic and Environmental Concerns**: Gen Z faces unique economic pressures, including concerns over job security, the gig economy, and the financial burden of education. They are also deeply concerned with environmental issues, often advocating for sustainable practices and climate change action.
    <br>5. **Political and Social Activism**: On platforms like X, Gen Z is often seen engaging in discussions about accountability, transparency in governance, and social justice. They're characterized by a desire for real change, which sometimes manifests in activism or calls for political action.
    <br>6. **Education and Career**: Despite being on track to be the most well-educated generation yet, they're pragmatic about career choices, with a significant focus on financial stability due to witnessing economic downturns. However, there's also a trend of delaying traditional milestones like marriage.
    <br>7. **Social Interactions**: There's a noted shift in dating and social interactions. Some posts on X highlight concerns over Gen Z men and women experiencing different social challenges, with discussions around the decline in traditional dating practices.
    <br>8. **Media Consumption**: Unlike millennials, Gen Z tends to prefer more anonymous or ephemeral forms of social media, reflecting a desire for privacy or less permanent digital footprints. They engage with content that's often more curated, personalized, and consumed in a less traditional, more mobile-oriented manner.
    <br>9. **Political Leanings**: While there's a stereotype of Gen Z being overwhelmingly liberal or progressive, there's also a growing discussion about conservative or right-leaning sentiments among some Gen Z men, as noted in some X posts, indicating a diversity in political thought within the generation.
    <br>10. **Cultural Shifts**: They're often described as more critical consumers of culture, preferring authenticity over the "cringe" aspects they associate with millennial culture. This includes a move away from overly curated social media presences towards more genuine or raw content.
    <br>Remember, while these trends and discussions provide a snapshot of Gen Z, individual experiences within the generation can vary widely. The information reflects broader societal observations and sentiments expressed on platforms like X but should not be taken as absolute for every member of Gen Z."

    <br>· How Many People Have Lived on Earth since Mankind Began?
    <br>Population researchers estimate that 108 billion people have lived since modern humans appeared 50,000 years ago.
    <br>As you read this, there are approximately 7.7 billion other people on the planet with you. That might seem like a lot, but look at it this way and your perspective might change: the current world population is only about 7 percent of all the people who have ever lived. According to the Population Reference Bureau, which makes regular updates to its statistics, more than 108 billion people have roamed the Earth since behaviorally and anatomically modern humans first appeared approximately 50,000 years ago.
    <br>The bureau acknowledges that much of its work is based on speculation, since there is no accurate data for 99 percent of the time mankind has existed, but figures can be approximated by looking at the length of time Homo sapiens have been around and the average size of the population at different times.

In fact, according to some recent research, online dating has grown from its humble beginnings -- YouTube was originally a dating site that lasted as such for only a few days because no one seemed interested -- to perhaps the most common way of meeting one's match. Reuben J. Thomas of the University of New Mexico and Michael Rosenfeld and Sonia Hausen of Stanford University analyzed findings from several earlier studies and came to the conclusion that dating apps have gained credibility over the years, and that has translated into successful relationships for both gay and straight people. According to their findings, 65 percent of same-sex couples and 39 percent of heterosexual couples who got involved in 2017 met online. “People used to make up stories about how they met, so they wouldn’t have to admit that they met online, but now many people embrace it," Thomas told the website Quartz.

    <br>"How Did Iceland Become a Leader in the Women's Rights Movement?
    <br>On Oct. 24, 1975, 90% of women in Iceland refused to work, either at home or at their jobs, demanding equal rights.
    <br>Sometimes the best way to win a fight is not to fight -- or do anything at all. That lesson was proven perfectly by the women of Iceland on October 24, 1975. Demanding equal rights, the female citizens decided that the ideal method of proving their merit was to show the men what they would be missing, so they stopped working, cooking, cleaning, and even tending to their children. The protest was no small event either, as 90 percent of the country's women joined in. The strike, which included the women taking to the streets, reverberated throughout the nation, with schools, businesses, and nurseries shuttering for the day, and fathers having little choice but to take their kids with them to work. Vigdis Finnbogadottir, who became Iceland's first female president five years after the strike, told the BBC that that single day -- commonly known as "Women's Day Off" -- changed the nation for good. "What happened that day was the first step for women's emancipation in Iceland," she said. "It completely paralyzed the country and opened the eyes of many men."

    <br>"Intersex people are individuals born with any of several variations in sex characteristics including chromosomes, gonads, sex hormones or genitals that, according to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, "do not fit the typical definitions for male or female bodies".[1][2] This range of atypical variation may be physically obvious from birth – babies may have ambiguous reproductive organs, or at the other extreme range it is not obvious and may remain unknown to people all their lives.[3]
    <br>Intersex people were previously referred to as hermaphrodites or "congenital eunuchs".[4][5] In the 19th and 20th centuries, some medical experts devised new nomenclature in an attempt to classify the characteristics that they had observed. It was the first attempt at creating a taxonomic classification system of intersex conditions. Intersex people were categorized as either having true hermaphroditism, female pseudohermaphroditism, or male pseudohermaphroditism.[6] These terms are no longer used: terms including the word "hermaphrodite" are considered to be misleading, stigmatizing, and scientifically specious in reference to humans.[7] A hermaphrodite is now defined as "an animal or plant having both male and female reproductive organs".[6] In 1917, Richard Goldschmidt created the term intersexuality to refer to a variety of physical sex ambiguities.[6] In clinical settings, the term "disorders of sex development" (DSD) has been used since 2006.[8] This shift has been controversial since the label was introduced.[9][10][11]
    <br>Intersex people face stigmatization and discrimination from birth, or from discovery of an intersex trait, such as from puberty. This may include infanticide, abandonment and the stigmatization of families.[12][13][14] Globally, some intersex infants and children, such as those with ambiguous outer genitalia, are surgically or hormonally altered to create more socially acceptable sex characteristics. However, this is considered controversial, with no firm evidence of favorable outcomes.[15] Such treatments may involve sterilization. Adults, including elite female athletes, have also been subjects of such treatment.[16][17] Increasingly, these issues are considered human rights abuses, with statements from international[18][19] and national human rights and ethics institutions (see intersex human rights).[20][21] Intersex organizations have also issued statements about human rights violations, including the 2013 Malta declaration of the third International Intersex Forum.[22]
    <br>Some intersex persons may be assigned and raised as a girl or boy but then identify with another gender later in life, while most continue to identify with their assigned sex.[23][24] In 2011, Christiane Völling became the first intersex person known to have successfully sued for damages in a case brought for non-consensual surgical intervention.[25] In April 2015, Malta became the first country to outlaw non-consensual medical interventions to modify sex anatomy, including that of intersex people."

    <br>"criminal definition
    <br>A criminal is a person who has been found guilty of committing a crime. In legal terms, a crime is an act or omission that is prohibited by law and is punishable by the state. Criminals are individuals who have been convicted in a court of law for their involvement in such unlawful activities. The specific definition of a criminal and the penalties associated with criminal behavior can vary widely from one jurisdiction to another, as laws and legal systems differ across countries and regions. Generally, criminal behavior can encompass a wide range of activities, from minor offenses like petty theft to more serious crimes such as murder, robbery, and fraud. The determination of what constitutes a criminal act and the subsequent legal consequences is typically made through a judicial process that involves a trial, where evidence is presented, and a verdict is rendered by a judge or jury."

    <br>"An asylum seeker is a person who has left their country of origin and is seeking international protection from persecution or serious human rights violations. They have not yet been legally recognized as a refugee.
    <br>
    <br>Asylum seekers may have fled their countries for a variety of reasons, including:
    <br>* War and conflict
    <br>* Political persecution
    <br>* Violence and torture
    <br>* Religious persecution
    <br>* Discrimination
    <br>
    <br>Asylum seekers have the right to seek asylum in another country, and they should not be penalized for doing so. However, the asylum process can be complex and time-consuming. Asylum seekers may have to wait for months or even years for a decision on their claim.
    <br>
    <br>In the meantime, asylum seekers may face a number of challenges, including:
    <br>* Access to basic necessities such as food, shelter, and medical care
    <br>* Discrimination and social exclusion
    <br>* Difficulty finding employment and education
    <br>* The fear of being returned to their country of origin
    <br>
    <br>Despite the challenges they face, asylum seekers are resilient and resourceful. They have often risked their lives to flee their home countries, and they are determined to build a new life for themselves and their families.
    <br>
    <br>Here are some ways to support asylum seekers:
    <br>* Donate to organizations that support asylum seekers, such as the UNHCR or Amnesty International.
    <br>* Volunteer your time to help asylum seekers with tasks such as finding housing, learning the language, or preparing for job interviews.
    <br>* Speak out against discrimination and xenophobia.
    <br>* Educate yourself about the asylum process and the challenges faced by asylum seekers.
    <br>
    <br>By supporting asylum seekers, we can help them to build a better future for themselves and their families."

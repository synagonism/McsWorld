    <br>">stakeholder of organization:
    <br>    <br>Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest or stake in the activities, outcomes, or success of an organization. They can significantly impact or be affected by the organization's actions and decisions. Stakeholders can be categorized into internal and external groups, and they may have varying degrees of influence. Here are some common types of stakeholders in an organization:
    <br>
    <br>1. **Internal Stakeholders:**
    <br>   - **Employees:** Individuals working within the organization at various levels.
    <br>   - **Management and Executives:** Leaders and decision-makers within the organization.
    <br>   - **Board of Directors:** Individuals elected or appointed to oversee the organization's management.
    <br>   - **Shareholders/Owners:** Individuals or entities that own shares or have equity in the organization.
    <br>   - **Volunteers:** Individuals contributing their time and skills to the organization without financial compensation.
    <br>
    <br>2. **External Stakeholders:**
    <br>   - **Customers/Clients:** Individuals or entities purchasing goods or services from the organization.
    <br>   - **Suppliers and Partners:** Entities providing goods, services, or resources to the organization.
    <br>   - **Government and Regulatory Bodies:** Agencies that regulate or have authority over the organization's industry or operations.
    <br>   - **Communities:** Local communities where the organization operates, and which may be affected by its activities.
    <br>   - **Investors:** Individuals or entities providing financial resources to support the organization.
    <br>   - **Media:** Journalists, reporters, and media outlets covering or reporting on the organization.
    <br>
    <br>3. **Other Stakeholders:**
    <br>   - **NGOs and Advocacy Groups:** Non-governmental organizations and groups that may advocate for specific causes related to the organization's activities.
    <br>   - **Competitors:** Other organizations operating in the same industry or market.
    <br>   - **Trade Unions:** Organizations representing the interests of employees or specific professions.
    <br>
    <br>Understanding and managing the needs and expectations of these stakeholders is crucial for the success and sustainability of an organization. Effective stakeholder management involves communication, engagement, and considering their interests in decision-making processes. Organizations often conduct stakeholder analysis to identify and prioritize stakeholders based on their influence, interest, and impact on the organization."

    <br>"An accounting framework is a published set of criteria that is used to measure, recognize, present, and disclose the information appearing in an entity's financial statements. An organization's financial statements must have been constructed using a recognized framework, or else auditors will not issue a clean audit opinion for them.
    <br>The most commonly-used accounting frameworks are generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and international financial reporting standards (IFRS). GAAP is used by entities in the United States, while IFRS is used in most other parts of the world. These two frameworks are designed to be broad-based and therefore applicable to most types of businesses. There are other accounting frameworks that are designed for special situations, and which are known as other comprehensive bases of accounting (OCBOA)."
    <br>[{2020-11-05} https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/2017/5/7/accounting-framework]
    <br>===
    <br>"An accounting standard is a document issued by a rule-setting body, stating the manner in which accounting transactions are to be recorded and reported. The entities that most commonly issue accounting standards are the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). When an organization follows accounting standards, its financial statements can then be audited by an outside auditor, which is a standard requirement by lenders, creditors, and investors.
    <br>Accounting standards cover a broad range of topics, including the following:
    <br>* General principles
    <br>* Presentation
    <br>* Assets
    <br>* Liabilities
    <br>* Equity

    <br>"IFRS is short for International Financial Reporting Standards. IFRS is the international accounting framework within which to properly organize and report financial information. It is derived from the pronouncements of the London-based International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). It is currently the required accounting framework in more than 120 countries. IFRS requires businesses to report their financial results and financial position using the same rules; this means that, barring any fraudulent manipulation, there is considerable uniformity in the financial reporting of all businesses using IFRS, which makes it easier to compare and contrast their financial results.
    <br>IFRS is used primarily by businesses reporting their financial results anywhere in the world except the United States. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, is the accounting framework used in the United States. GAAP is much more rules-based than IFRS. IFRS focuses more on general principles than GAAP, which makes the IFRS body of work much smaller, cleaner, and easier to understand than GAAP.
    <br>IFRS covers a broad array of topics, including:
    <br>* Presentation of financial statements
    <br>* Revenue recognition
    <br>* Employee benefits
    <br>* Borrowing costs
    <br>* Income taxes
    <br>* Investment in associates
    <br>* Inventories
    <br>* Fixed assets
    <br>* Intangible assets
    <br>* Leases
    <br>* Retirement benefit plans
    <br>* Business combinations
    <br>* Foreign exchange rates
    <br>* Operating segments
    <br>* Subsequent events
    <br>Industry-specific accounting, such as mineral resources and agriculture
    <br>There are several working groups that are gradually reducing the differences between the GAAP and IFRS accounting frameworks, so eventually there should be minor differences in the reported results of a business if it switches between the two frameworks. There is a stated intent to eventually merge GAAP into IFRS, but this has not yet occurred.
    <br>There will be a reduced cost for companies once the two accounting frameworks are more closely aligned, since they will not have to pay to have their financial statements restated to show results under the other framework in cases where they need to report their results in locations where the other framework is required."

    <br>"China has started to develop its own accounting rules referred to as the Chinese Accounting Standards (CAS) since 1992. Despite substantial convergence between CAS and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) that most western investors are used to, practical implementation and interpretation differences remain.
    <br>The CAS framework, also known as Chinese Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (Chinese GAAP), is based on two standards:
    <br>• Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises (ASBEs); and
    <br>• Accounting Standards for Small Business Enterprises (ASSBEs)"
    <br>[{2024-06-16 retrieved} https://www.asiabriefing.com/store/book/a-quick-guide-to-accounting-and-audit-in-china-2024-9835.html]
    <br>
    <br>"Chinese Accounting Standards (CAS) are the accounting rules used in mainland China. These standards have undergone significant development over the years, converging with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) while maintaining some unique characteristics.
    <br>
    <br>**History and Development**
    <br>Chinese accounting standards originated in the socialist era when the state was the primary owner of industries. Initially, they served as an inventory of assets rather than a tool for measuring profit and loss. As China's economy transitioned towards a market-oriented system, CAS evolved to meet the demands of a changing business landscape.
    <br>In 2006, the Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China issued a new set of Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises (ASBEs), which marked a significant step towards convergence with IFRS. Since then, ASBEs have become mandatory for listed companies in China, while other enterprises are encouraged to adopt them.
    <br>
    <br>**Key Components**
    <br>The CAS framework consists of:
    <br>* **Basic Standard:**  This outlines the fundamental principles and concepts underlying financial reporting in China.
    <br>* **Specific Standards:** These address specific accounting topics such as revenue recognition, leases, and financial instruments.
    <br>* **Application Guidance:** This provides interpretations and clarifications on how to apply the standards in practice.
    <br>
    <br>**Convergence with IFRS**
    <br>The convergence between CAS and IFRS has been a gradual process. While significant progress has been made, some differences remain. These differences primarily stem from the unique economic and regulatory environment in China. However, the Ministry of Finance is committed to further aligning CAS with IFRS to enhance the comparability and transparency of financial reporting in China.
    <br>
    <br>**Practical Implications**
    <br>The adoption of ASBEs has had several practical implications for businesses operating in China:
    <br>* **Enhanced Transparency:** The convergence with IFRS has made financial statements of Chinese companies more transparent and understandable to international investors.
    <br>* **Improved Comparability:** The alignment of CAS with IFRS has facilitated the comparison of financial performance between Chinese and foreign companies.
    <br>* **Increased Investor Confidence:** The adoption of globally recognized accounting standards has boosted investor confidence in the Chinese market.
    <br>* **Challenges for Small Enterprises:** Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) may face challenges in implementing ASBEs due to their complexity and resource constraints.
    <br>
    <br>**Future Outlook**
    <br>The future of Chinese accounting standards is expected to be characterized by continued convergence with IFRS. The Ministry of Finance is actively working on further aligning CAS with global standards to promote transparency, comparability, and investor confidence.
    <br>
    <br>**Additional Resources**
    <br>For further information on Chinese accounting standards, you may refer to the following resources:
    <br>* **Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China:**  This official website provides information on the latest developments in CAS.
    <br>* **IAS Plus:** This website offers a comprehensive overview of accounting standards in China, including updates on the convergence with IFRS.
    <br>* **Deloitte CAS Plus:** This website provides insights and resources on Chinese accounting standards, including comparisons with IFRS.

  <p id="idOgznatt029GaapdsnL">descriptionLong::
    <br>"GAAP is short for Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. GAAP is a cluster of accounting standards and common industry usage that have been developed over many years. It is used by organizations to:
    <br>* Properly organize their financial information into accounting records;
    <br>* Summarize the accounting records into financial statements; and
    <br>* Disclose certain supporting information.
    <br>One of the reasons for using GAAP is so that anyone reading the financial statements of multiple companies has a reasonable basis for comparison, since all companies using GAAP have created their financial statements using the same set of rules.
    <br>Sources of GAAP
    <br>GAAP is derived from the pronouncements of a series of government-sponsored accounting entities, of which the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is the latest. The Securities and Exchange Commission also issues accounting pronouncements through its Accounting Staff Bulletins and other announcements that are applicable only to publicly-held companies, and which are considered to be part of GAAP. GAAP is codified into the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), which is available online and (more legibly) in printed form.
    <br>GAAP Topics
    <br>GAAP covers a broad array of topics, including the following:
    <br>* Financial statement presentation
    <br>* Assets
    <br>* Liabilities
    <br>* Equity
    <br>* Revenue
    <br>* Expenses
    <br>* Business combinations
    <br>* Derivatives and hedging
    <br>* Fair value
    <br>* Foreign currency
    <br>* Leases
    <br>* Nonmonetary transactions
    <br>* Subsequent events
    <br>Industry-specific accounting, such as airlines, extractive activities, and health care
    <br>The industry-specific accounting that is allowed or required under GAAP may vary substantially from the more generic standards for certain accounting transactions.
    <br>Users of GAAP
    <br>GAAP is used primarily by businesses reporting their financial results in the United States. International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS, is the accounting framework used in most other countries. GAAP is much more rules-based than IFRS. IFRS focuses more on general principles than GAAP, which makes the IFRS body of work much smaller, cleaner, and easier to understand than GAAP. Since IFRS is still being constructed, GAAP is considered to be the more comprehensive accounting framework.
    <br>GAAP Convergence with IFRS
    <br>There are several working groups that are gradually reducing the differences between the GAAP and IFRS accounting frameworks, so eventually there should be minor differences in the reported results of a business if it switches between the two. There is a stated intent to eventually merge GAAP into IFRS, but this has not yet occurred. Given recent differences of opinion arising during several joint projects, it is possible that the frameworks will never be merged."

    <br>* A balance sheet or statement of financial position, reports on a company's assets, liabilities, and owners equity at a given point in time.
    <br>* An income statement—or profit and loss report (P&L report), or statement of comprehensive income, or statement of revenue & expense—reports on a company's income, expenses, and profits over a stated period. A profit and loss statement provides information on the operation of the enterprise. These include sales and the various expenses incurred during the stated period.
    <br>* A statement of changes in equity or statement of equity, or statement of retained earnings, reports on the changes in equity of the company over a stated period.
    <br>* A cash flow statement reports on a company's cash flow activities, particularly its operating, investing and financing activities over a stated period.
    <br>* A comprehensive income statement involves those other comprehensive income items which are not included while determining net income.
    <br>(Notably, a balance sheet represents a single point in time, where the income statement, the statement of changes in equity, and the cash flow statement each represent activities over a stated period.)
    <br>For large corporations, these statements may be complex and may include an extensive set of footnotes to the financial statements and management discussion and analysis. The notes typically describe each item on the balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement in further detail. Notes to financial statements are considered an integral part of the financial statements."

    <br>"In financial accounting, a balance sheet (also known as statement of financial position or statement of financial condition) is a summary of the financial balances of an individual or organization, whether it be a sole proprietorship, a business partnership, a corporation, private limited company or other organization such as government or not-for-profit entity. Assets, liabilities and ownership equity are listed as of a specific date, such as the end of its financial year. A balance sheet is often described as a "snapshot of a company's financial condition".[1] Of the four basic financial statements, the balance sheet is the only statement which applies to a single point in time of a business' calendar year.
    <br>A standard company balance sheet has two sides: assets on the left, and financing on the right–which itself has two parts; liabilities and ownership equity. The main categories of assets are usually listed first, and typically in order of liquidity.[2] Assets are followed by the liabilities. The difference between the assets and the liabilities is known as equity or the net assets or the net worth or capital of the company and according to the accounting equation, net worth must equal assets minus liabilities.[3]"

  <p id="idOgznatt030dsn">description::
    <br>"What Is Bookkeeping?
    <br>Bookkeeping is a crucial first step in the accounting process. Think of bookkeepers as athletes who start the track relay. They lay the foundation for accountants by recording financial transactions. Once the first leg of the race is finished, they hand over the batons—the financial information contained in ledgers and journals—to accountants to complete the race. (That’s not to say that accountants can’t and won’t record transactions—they can and often will. This analogy simply illustrates the differences in roles).
    <br>By recording transactions, bookkeepers track your finances so you can view at a glance how much money is entering and leaving your business. And because they’re tax compliant, you can feel confident they’ll keep you on the straight and narrow.
    <br>But what exactly are some of the tasks bookkeepers do? Here are six common bookkeeping tasks:
    <br>1. Recording income from services as well as expenses such as rent, utilities and office supplies
    <br>2. Managing payroll, though this is not a core bookkeeping function
    <br>3. Creating invoices and making payments for you—this depends on your specific arrangement with them
    <br>4. Comparing the balances in your books against bank transactions to see if they match. If not, they make adjustments and create bank reconciliation statements to record these discrepancies.
    <br>5. Tracking accounts payable (money you owe) and accounts receivable (money owed to you). Bookkeepers keep tabs on all invoices and due dates and follow up with late payers. They will also make sure that you pay your accounts on time and don’t pay twice. As soon as the payment is made they will record the amount as a business expense in the ledger.
    <br>6. Maintaining the general ledger, which is the master accounting document that stores all your financial transactions. The general ledger typically uses the double-entry accounting method, meaning for every debit on one account there’s a corresponding credit on another. Your bookkeeper will:
    <br>* Post relevant credit and debits to your journal before transferring it over to the general ledger
    <br>* Ensure these debits and credits balance
    <br>* Record all income and expenses in this way
    <br>What Is Accounting?
    <br>The accountant will now use the recorded data to interpret, analyze and report on the financial health of the business. Because they offer more detailed insights that inform business decisions, you wouldn’t want to hire an accountant to only record income and expenses. You’d pay more for the same service a bookkeeper could do for less, and in the process, underutilize the accountant’s expertise. Here are four tasks that an accountant performs:
    <br>1. Preparing financial statements to help you see the bigger picture and assess the financial health of your business, including:
    <br>* Balance sheets: A snapshot of your financial situation at a point in time, calculated through this formula: Assets = Equity – Liabilities
    <br>* Income statements: A record of all your income and expenses over a period of time
    <br>* Cash flow statement: A record of cash flowing in and out of your business for a period of time
    <br>2. Analyzing journals and ledger entries, and making adjustments, e.g., accountants will identify any incurred expenses that have not yet been recorded
    <br>3. Providing tax advice and completing and filing tax returns
    <br>4. Offering financial advice and helping understand the consequences of your financial decisions"

    <br>"A tax is a compulsory financial charge or some other type of levy imposed on a taxpayer (an individual or legal entity) by a governmental organization in order to fund government spending and various public expenditures.[2] A failure to pay, along with evasion of or resistance to taxation, is punishable by law. Taxes consist of direct or indirect taxes and may be paid in money or as its labour equivalent. The first known taxation took place in Ancient Egypt around 3000–2800 BC.
    <br>Most countries have a tax system in place to pay for public, common, or agreed national needs and government functions. Some levy a flat percentage rate of taxation on personal annual income, but most scale taxes based on annual income amounts. Most countries charge a tax on an individual's income as well as on corporate income. Countries or subunits often also impose wealth taxes, inheritance taxes, estate taxes, gift taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, payroll taxes or tariffs.
    <br>In economic terms, taxation transfers wealth from households or businesses to the government. This has effects which can both increase and reduce economic growth and economic welfare. Consequently, taxation is a highly debated topic."

  <div id="idOgznatt001qcvgdsn">description::
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;"Quadratic Voting is a system where each individual is given an equal amount of non-transferable credits. These credits act as a budget to make decisions, where each individual can express the degree of preference based on the number of credits they spend on a vote. Holding a stronger preference will become progressively expensive and in consequence depleting your budget of credits, leaving low or no credits to spend on other decisions.
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr><td># of Votes<td>Cost in Credits
      <tr><td>1<td>1
      <tr><td>2<td>4
      <tr><td>3<td>9
      <tr><td>4<td>16
      <tr><td>n<td>n^2
    </table>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;In other words, it is cheaper to have little influence on many issues but is expensive to have a lot of influence on one issue. Voters will have to prioritize their needs and intentions, they can choose to use a single vote in all issues, or they can exercise their right to apply the degree of preference to the cost of their credits.
    <br>Example:
    <br>Company "X" is about to hold a board member meeting to decide on the budget allocation for the next year. The board consists of 3 members, Alice, Lucy, and Bob. The areas to allocate fundings are Marketing, Development, User Experience, and Legal. Each one of the board members will receive 4 credits, the board members can choose to spend their credits on the areas they believe would be key to grow next year.
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr><td>Board<td>Marketing<td>Development<td>User Experience<td>Legal
      <tr><td>Alice<td>1<td>1<td>1<td>1
      <tr><td>Lucy<td>2<td><td><td>
      <tr><td>Bob<td><td>2<td><td>
    </table>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;In this example, Bob and Lucy applied their degree of preference by voting on the areas they believed the company needed to grow. Whereas Alice, played it safe allocating one single vote on all areas. In this example, Marketing and Development will receive 37.5% each of the allocation budget, and User Experience and Legal will receive 12.5% each.
    <br>This way people get a powerful tool to express their will the way they want: voting for the issues they consider more important and giving those issues a stronger preference."

  <p id="idOgznatt021dsn">description::
    <br>"Organizational theory consists of many approaches to organizational analysis. "Organizations" are defined as social units of people that are structured and managed to meet a need, or to pursue collective goals. Theories of organizations include rational system perspective, division of labor, bureaucratic theory, and contingency theory.
    <br>In a rational organization system, there are two significant parts: Specificity of Goals and Formalization. The division of labor is the specialization of individual labor roles, associated with increasing output and trade. Modernization theorist Frank Dobbin states that "modern institutions are transparently purposive and that we are in the midst of an evolutionary progression towards more efficient forms." Max Weber's conception of bureaucracy is characterized by the presence of impersonal positions that are earned and not inherited, rule-governed decision-making, professionalism, chain of command, defined responsibility, and bounded authority. The contingency theory holds that an organization must try to maximize performance by minimizing the effects of varying environmental and internal constraints.
    <br>As noted by Dwight Waldo in a review of field work in 1978, "Organization theory is characterized by vogues, heterogeneity, claims and counterclaims;"[1] even greater differentiation in theory and practice have developed since then. Organization theory cannot be described as an orderly progression of ideas, or a unified body of knowledge in which each development builds carefully on and extends the one before it. Rather, developments in theory and prescriptions for practice show disagreement about the purposes and uses of a theory of organization, the issues to which it should address itself (such as supervisory style and organizational culture), and the concepts and variables that should enter into such a theory."

    <br>"Management science (MS) is the broad interdisciplinary study of problem solving and decision making in human organizations, with strong links to management, economics, business, engineering, management consulting, and other fields. It uses various scientific research-based principles, strategies, and analytical methods including mathematical modeling, statistics and numerical algorithms to improve an organization's ability to enact rational and accurate management decisions by arriving at optimal or near optimal solutions to complex decision problems. Management science helps businesses to achieve goals using various scientific methods.
    <br>The field was initially an outgrowth of applied mathematics, where early challenges were problems relating to the optimization of systems which could be modeled linearly, i.e., determining the optima (maximum value of profit, assembly line performance, crop yield, bandwidth, etc. or minimum of loss, risk, costs, etc.) of some objective function. Today, management science encompasses any organizational activity for which a problem is structured in mathematical form to generate managerially relevant insights."

    <br>"Organizational analysis or more commonly Industrial analysis is the process of reviewing the development, work environment, personnel, and operation of a business or another type of association.[1] This review is often performed in response to crisis, but may also be carried out as part of a demonstration project, in the process of taking a program to scale, or in the course of regular operations. Conducting a periodic detailed organizational analysis can be a useful way for management to identify problems or inefficiencies that have arisen in the organization but have yet to be addressed, and develop strategies for resolving them.[1]
    <br>Organizational analysis focuses on the structure and design of the organization and how the organization's systems, capacity and functionality influence outputs. Additional internal and external factors are also accounted for in assessing how to improve efficiency. Undertaking an organizational analysis is helpful in assessing an organization's current well-being and capacity, and deciding on a course of action to improve the organization's long-term sustainability. A restructuring of an Organization may become necessary when either external or internal forces have created a problem or opportunity for improvement in efficiency and effectiveness.
    <br>When performing an organizational analysis, many details emerge about the functions and capacity of the organization. All of these details can make pinpointing what is efficient and inefficient difficult. Using theoretical organizational models can help sort out the information, and make it easier to draw connections. After working through these theoretical models, the organizations present situation is more adequately addressed, and the trajectory of the organization can be more fully determined."

  <p id="idOgzn011dsn">description::
    <br>"A "budgetless company" refers to an organization that operates without a traditional budget. Instead of setting detailed financial plans and allocations in advance, such companies rely on alternative financial management and decision-making processes. The concept aims to increase flexibility, adaptability, and responsiveness to changing market conditions. Here are some key features and principles of a budgetless company:
    <br>1. **Continuous Planning and Forecasting**:
    <br>   - Instead of annual budgeting, the company engages in continuous planning and rolling forecasts. This allows for more accurate and up-to-date financial projections based on real-time data and changing circumstances.
    <br>2. **Decentralized Decision-Making**:
    <br>   - Financial decision-making authority is often decentralized, empowering teams and departments to make spending decisions based on their immediate needs and objectives. This fosters a sense of ownership and accountability.
    <br>3. **Focus on Strategic Goals and KPIs**:
    <br>   - The company emphasizes achieving strategic goals and key performance indicators (KPIs) rather than adhering to a rigid budget. Resources are allocated based on their potential to drive strategic outcomes.
    <br>4. **Adaptive Resource Allocation**:
    <br>   - Resources are allocated dynamically as needed, rather than being predetermined at the beginning of the fiscal year. This flexibility allows the company to respond quickly to opportunities and challenges.
    <br>5. **Transparency and Trust**:
    <br>   - A culture of transparency and trust is crucial in a budgetless company. Open communication about financial performance, priorities, and challenges ensures that everyone is aligned and working towards common goals.
    <br>6. **Performance-Based Incentives**:
    <br>   - Employee incentives and rewards are often tied to performance metrics and the achievement of strategic objectives rather than adherence to budgetary constraints.
    <br>7. **Lean and Agile Methodologies**:
    <br>   - The company may adopt lean and agile methodologies to streamline processes, eliminate waste, and continuously improve efficiency. This approach supports a flexible and responsive operational model.
    <br>8. **Scenario Planning**:
    <br>   - Scenario planning and analysis are used to prepare for various potential future conditions. This helps the company to be better prepared for uncertainties and to make informed decisions quickly.
    <br>While operating without a traditional budget can offer many advantages, it also requires a strong organizational culture, effective communication, and robust financial management systems to ensure that resources are used wisely and strategically. Companies that have successfully adopted budgetless management include some in the tech and innovation sectors, where rapid change and adaptability are crucial."

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idOgzn009H2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idOgzn009dsn">description::
    <br>">decentralized vs self-managing organization:
    <br>The concepts of decentralized organizations and self-managing organizations represent two approaches to organizational design and management, each with its unique characteristics and advantages. Understanding the distinctions between them can help in identifying the best approach for a specific context or goal.
    <br>### Decentralized Organizations
    <br>Decentralized organizations distribute decision-making power away from a central command structure to more localized units or individuals within the organization. This approach can be seen in various degrees and forms, from companies that allow branches or teams to make decisions independently, to blockchain-based organizations that use technology to distribute control among its members.
    <br>**Advantages:**
    <br>- **Increased Agility:** Local units can respond more quickly to changes and challenges in their immediate environment.
    <br>- **Empowerment:** Employees often feel more valued and empowered when they have a say in decision-making, which can improve motivation and job satisfaction.
    <br>- **Innovation:** Decentralization can foster innovation as different units have the freedom to experiment and implement new ideas without waiting for approval from a central authority.
    <br>**Challenges:**
    <br>- **Coordination:** Ensuring consistent strategy and action across the organization can be more challenging.
    <br>- **Risk of Divergence:** Different parts of the organization may pursue conflicting goals or strategies without strong central coordination.
    <br>- **Complexity:** Managing a decentralized organization can be complex, requiring sophisticated communication and monitoring systems.
    <br>### Self-Managing Organizations
    <br>Self-managing organizations take the concept of decentralization further by eliminating or significantly reducing traditional management roles. Instead, teams or individuals have the autonomy to make decisions regarding their work, from setting goals to managing projects and resources. Examples include holacracy and certain agile management models.
    <br>**Advantages:**
    <br>- **High Flexibility and Responsiveness:** Teams can adapt quickly to new information or situations without waiting for decisions from the top.
    <br>- **Increased Engagement and Satisfaction:** Workers have more control over their work, leading to higher engagement, satisfaction, and often productivity.
    <br>- **Reduced Overhead:** By reducing the need for traditional management layers, organizations can operate more leanly and efficiently.
    <br>**Challenges:**
    <br>- **Scaling Issues:** While effective in small to medium organizations, scaling self-management in large organizations can be challenging.
    <br>- **Decision-Making Efficiency:** Without clear decision-making structures, decisions can sometimes take longer as consensus is sought.
    <br>- **Skill Requirements:** Requires employees who are not only skilled in their domain but also capable of managing their workload, conflicts, and decision-making processes.
    <br>### Conclusion
    <br>The choice between a decentralized and a self-managing organizational structure depends on various factors, including the size of the organization, the industry, the organizational culture, and the specific goals the organization aims to achieve. Decentralization offers a balance between autonomy and coordination, while self-management pushes autonomy to the forefront, emphasizing empowerment and flexibility. Both approaches aim to make organizations more agile, innovative, and responsive to their environments, but they do so in different ways and with different implications for management and operations."

  <p id="idOgzn009clngdsn">description::
    <br>"Working in a self-managed organization is fun, liberating, and extremely rewarding. Both our companies, Corporate Rebels and Krisos, are set up as self-managing teams.
    <br>No bosses. No hierarchy. Instead, everyone takes initiative within their own roles, leading their areas of the business and involving others where necessary.
    <br>Most people see why that's a great environment to work in. And if you’ve been following this newsletter for some time, you know we love it.
    <br>That being said, it’s important to understand it’s not all rainbows and sunshine.
    <br>Today, I want to talk about the other side.
    <br>
    <br>The struggles, the challenges, the pains
    <br>Let’s dive into the challenges of self-management – both from personal experience and from the research we’ve conducted into self-managing organizations from around the world. For those of you working in a self-managed company or team, prepare for some aha moments.
    <br>
    <br>1. The paradox of freedom
    <br>In self-managed organizations, we often talk about freedom. Freedom to make decisions, freedom to shape your work, freedom from bureaucracy. But it doesn’t come in solitude: with great freedom comes great responsibility. And sometimes, that responsibility can feel overwhelming.
    <br>You're not just responsible for your tasks, but for the entire ecosystem around them. You need to consider how your decisions impact others, how they align with the company's purpose, and how they contribute to the bigger picture.
    <br>There’s nowhere to hide. No manager to save you when the going gets tough. Sure, there’s (hopefully) a supportive team around you, but they’re there to support, not to take over your responsibility.
    <br>It's exhilarating, sure, but it can also be paralyzing and uncomfortable.
    <br>
    <br>2. The leadership challenge
    <br>In self-managed organizations, leadership becomes a delicate dance. It's about knowing when to step up and take charge, and when to step back and let others shine. This constant shifting between leading and following is a skill that doesn't come naturally to most.
    <br>One day you're driving a project forward, rallying the troops. The next, you're supporting a colleague's initiative from the sidelines. Finding this balance is tough. It requires a level of self-awareness and flexibility that can be mentally exhausting. It's a constant struggle to know when to assert yourself and when to create space for others.
    <br>Personally, I regularly struggle with this. Especially with roles that are closely connected to mine that I’m highly passionate about. My enthusiasm sometimes eclipses the space that others need to thrive.
    <br>Clearly, a work in progress 😅.
    <br>
    <br>3. The autonomy-alignment tightrope
    <br>Self-management offers a great deal of autonomy within roles. You're the captain of your own ship. But here's the catch: we're all sailing in the same fleet. The challenge lies in finding the right balance between individual autonomy and organizational alignment.
    <br>Too much autonomy without alignment can lead to chaos, with everyone rowing in different directions. Too much alignment without autonomy can stifle creativity and lead to the very bureaucracy we're trying to avoid. Walking this tightrope is a constant challenge, requiring ongoing communication and adjustment.
    <br>Currently, at Corporate Rebels, we’re finetuning our balance. With lots of new developments, projects, and opportunities popping up, everyone was heading off too much in their own direction. Great in terms of autonomy, but not in terms of alignment.
    <br>We’re redoing our strategy now and will jointly evaluate new big opportunities. To guide the passion and the autonomy in the same direction.
    <br>
    <br>4. The skill gap challenge
    <br>Self-management requires a unique set of skills that most of us weren't taught in school or previous jobs. Suddenly, you need to be adept at taking responsibility, conflict resolution, strategic thinking, and collaborative decision-making.
    <br>For many, it feels like being thrust onto a black diamond ski slope with only sledding experience. It takes time, training, and a whole lot of practice to master it.
    <br>Remember, every expert on that slope was once a nervous novice at the top. The key is to start, persist, and never stop learning.
    <br>
    <br>5. The emotional toll
    <br>Here's something we don't talk about enough: self-management can be emotionally draining. When you're deeply invested in your work and your team, conflicts hit harder. Failures feel more personal. The line between professional and personal blurs, and that can be tough to navigate.
    <br>So, to all you self-management practitioners out there, I salute you. It's not an easy path, but it's a worthy one.
    <br>And to those considering this approach, go in with your eyes open. It's a rollercoaster ride, but one that can lead to incredible growth and fulfillment.
    <br>What about you? Have you experienced similar challenges in your self-managed organization? How do you deal with them? Hit reply and let me know. I'm always eager to learn from fellow rebels.
    <br>Until next time, keep pushing boundaries and embracing the beautiful chaos of self-management.
    <br>Cheers!"

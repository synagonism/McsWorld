    <br>">household etymology:
    <br>The etymology of the word "household" comes from the Old English words "hūs" meaning "house" and "haldan" (or "healdan") meaning "to hold, keep, maintain." The term "household" originally referred to the act of keeping or maintaining a house and, by extension, came to represent the people who live in a house and manage domestic affairs. It embodies the concept of a residential unit where members live together, share responsibilities, and provide for one another.
    <br>Over time, the term has come to signify not just the physical structure of a home and its inhabitants, but also the social and economic unit that they constitute. A household can include family members related by blood, marriage, or adoption, as well as non-relatives who live together in a domestic setting. The definition of what constitutes a household can vary significantly across different cultures and legal systems, reflecting diverse living arrangements and social structures.
    <br>The evolution of the term "household" reflects changes in social organization, living arrangements, and the recognition of various forms of domestic partnerships and cohabitations. It encompasses the idea of shared living space and communal life, highlighting the importance of the household as a fundamental unit in society for economic, social, and personal well-being."

    <br>">νοικοκυριό ετυμολογία:
    <br>Η λέξη "νοικοκυριό" προέρχεται από το μεσαιωνικό ελληνικό "νοικοκυριό".
    <br>Η λέξη "νοικοκυριό" με τη σειρά της προέρχεται από το ρήμα "νοικοκυρεύω", που σημαίνει "διοικώ ένα σπίτι".
    <br>Το "νοικοκυρεύω" προέρχεται από το "νοικοκύρης", που σημαίνει "αρχηγός του σπιτιού".
    <br>Η λέξη "νοικοκύρης" αποτελείται από δύο λέξεις:
    <br>* "νους" (νοῦς) που σημαίνει "διάνοια, λογική"
    <br>* "κύριος" (κῦριος) που σημαίνει "άρχοντας, κύριος"
    <br>Επομένως, η ετυμολογική ανάλυση της λέξης "νοικοκυριό" μας δίνει την έννοια του "**σπιτιού που διοικείται από έναν λογικό και άξιο άνδρα**".
    <br>**Συνοπτικά:**
    <br>* νοικοκυριό &lt; νοικοκυρεύω &lt; νοικοκύρης &lt; νους + κύριος

  <p id="idOverviewdsnL">descriptionLong::
    <br>"4.4 For purposes of the SNA, a household is a group of persons who share the same living accommodation, who pool some, or all, of their income and wealth and who consume certain types of goods and services collectively, mainly housing and food.
    <br>As well as individual households, there are units described as institutional households that comprise groups of persons staying in hospitals, retirement homes, convents, prisons, etc. for long periods of time.
    <br>4.5 The individual members of multiperson households are not treated as separate institutional units.
    <br>Many assets are owned, or liabilities incurred, jointly by two or more members of the same household while some or all of the income received by individual members of the same household may be pooled for the benefit of all members.
    <br>Moreover, many expenditure decisions, especially those relating to the consumption of food, or housing, may be made collectively for the household as a whole.
    <br>It may be impossible, therefore, to draw up meaningful balance sheets or other accounts for members of the household on an individual basis.
    <br>For these reasons, the household as a whole rather than the individual persons in it must be treated as the institutional unit."

    <br>===
    <br>"A household consists of one or more people who live in the same dwelling and share meals. It may also consist of a single family or another group of people.[1] A dwelling is considered[by whom?] to contain multiple households if meals or living spaces are not shared. The household is the basic unit of analysis in many social, microeconomic and government models, and is important to economics and inheritance.[2]
    <br>Household models include families, blended families, shared housing, group homes, boarding houses, houses of multiple occupancy (UK), and single room occupancy (US). In feudal societies, the Royal Household and medieval households of the wealthy included servants and other retainers.
    <br>... Economic definition
    <br>Although a one-income-stream economic theory simplifies modeling, it does not necessarily reflect reality. Many, if not most, households have several income-earning members. Most economic models do not equate households and traditional families, and there is not always a one-to-one relationship between households and families."
    <br>[{2020-10-26} https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household]
    <br>===
    <br>">aggregate global households:
    <br>The term "aggregate global households" generally refers to the process of combining or summarizing information from households across the world to analyze or understand global trends, behaviors, or characteristics. This can be applied in various contexts such as economic analysis, demographic studies, social research, and more.
    <br>When aggregating data from global households, several factors are usually considered:
    <br>1. **Demographics**: Information like age, gender, family size, and ethnic background.
    <br>2. **Economic Status**: Income levels, employment status, and financial resources.
    <br>3. **Living Conditions**: Type of housing, ownership or rental status, and living standards.
    <br>4. **Geographical Location**: Urban or rural settings, country, and regional specifics.
    <br>5. **Lifestyle and Cultural Factors**: Education levels, health conditions, dietary habits, and cultural practices.
    <br>6. **Technology Usage**: Access to and use of modern technology, internet, and digital services.
    <br>This aggregation helps in understanding global patterns such as poverty levels, education standards, health issues, economic development, and the impact of global events like pandemics or economic crises. It's important in shaping policies, directing aid, and understanding the global economy and social structure. However, this process involves challenges like ensuring data accuracy, respecting privacy, and dealing with diverse data collection methods and standards across different countries."

    <br>"Household final consumption expenditure (POES) is a transaction of the national account's use of income account representing consumer spending. It consists of the expenditure incurred by resident households on individual consumption goods and services, including those sold at prices that are not economically significant. It also includes various kinds of imputed expenditure of which the imputed rent for services of owner-occupied housing (imputed rents) is generally the most important one. The household sector covers not only those living in traditional households, but also those people living in communal establishments, such as retirement homes, boarding houses and prisons.
    <br>The above given definition of HFCE includes expenditure by resident households on the domestic territory and expenditure by resident households abroad (outbound tourists), but excludes any non-resident households' expenditure on the domestic territory (inbound tourists). From this national definition of consumption expenditure may be distinguished the household final consumption expenditure according to the domestic concept which includes household expenditure made on the domestic territory by residents and inbound tourists, but excludes residents' expenditure made abroad.
    <br>HFCE is measured at purchasers' prices which is the price the purchaser actually pays at the time of the purchase. It includes non-deductible value added tax and other taxes on products, transport and marketing costs and tips paid over and above stated prices.[1]
    <br>Components
    <br>Household final consumption expenditure includes the following components:
    <br>* households' purchases of products for their everyday needs (e.g. food, clothing, cars, rents, personal services)
    <br>* households' partial payments for products provided by the general government (e.g. tickets to public museums and swimming pools)
    <br>* households' payments to the general government for licences and permits (e.g. fees for issuing passports)
    <br>* imputed rents for services of owner-occupied housing
    <br>* household's own account consumption of outputs produced by unincorporated enterprises owned by households (e.g. own-consumption of milk produced on a farm)
    <br>* income in kind earned by employees (free or reduced train tickets for railway employees)
    <br>* households' consumption of Financial Intermediation Services Indirectly Measured (FISIM)"

    <br>">definition of wealth:
    <br>Wealth refers to the abundance of valuable resources or material possessions that an individual, group, or organization possesses. It is a measure of the accumulation of assets of economic value. Wealth encompasses a wide range of assets, including:
    <br>- **Monetary Assets**: This includes liquid assets like cash and bank deposits.
    <br>- **Investments**: Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, retirement accounts, and other investment vehicles.
    <br>- **Real Estate**: Ownership of land, houses, commercial buildings, and other real property.
    <br>- **Personal Property**: Valuable items like cars, jewelry, art, and other collectibles.
    <br>- **Business Ownership**: Interests in businesses, including shares in privately-held companies or entrepreneurial ventures.
    <br>Wealth is not just about having a lot of money; it's about having a variety of assets that can include both tangible and intangible items. It's also associated with the ability to generate income, maintain financial security, and sustain a certain lifestyle. Wealth can be used to measure financial health, economic status, and the potential for future financial growth or stability. It's a broader concept than income, which refers to the flow of money received from work, investments, or other sources. Wealth is more about the stock of valuable assets accumulated over time."

    <br>">are wealth and net-worth same?
    <br>Wealth and net worth are often used interchangeably, but they are slightly different concepts.
    <br>**Net worth** is the most common measure of wealth. It is calculated by subtracting your total liabilities from your total assets. In other words, net worth is what you own minus what you owe.
    <br>**Wealth** is a broader concept that encompasses not only your net worth, but also your other financial resources, such as your income, savings, and investments. It is a measure of your overall financial well-being.
    <br>So, while net worth is a specific measure of your financial situation, wealth is a more general term that encompasses your entire financial picture.
    <br>Here is a table that summarizes the key differences between wealth and net worth:
    <br>| Feature | Wealth | Net worth |
    <br>| Definition | A comprehensive measure of your overall financial well-being | A specific measure of your financial situation |
    <br>| Measurement | Net worth = Assets - Liabilities | Net worth = Total assets - Total liabilities |
    <br>| Focus | Overall financial picture | Current financial situation |
    <br>I hope this helps!"

    <br>">global household wealth:
    <br>Global household wealth is estimated to have reached $454.4 trillion in 2022, up from $398.7 trillion in 2021. This represents a 13.3% increase in real terms. The growth was driven by strong performance in equity markets, as well as rising real estate prices in many parts of the world.
    <br>**Distribution of Global Household Wealth**
    <br>The distribution of global household wealth is very uneven. The top 1% of the world's wealthiest households hold 45.8% of all household wealth, while the bottom 50% of households hold just 2.5%. This means that the richest 1% of the world's households are 17 times wealthier than the median household.
    <br>**Top 10 Countries by Household Wealth**
    <br>The top 10 countries by household wealth in 2022 were:
    <br>1. United States: $156.3 trillion
    <br>2. China: $134.1 trillion
    <br>3. Japan: $49.9 trillion
    <br>4. Germany: $47.2 trillion
    <br>5. United Kingdom: $44.3 trillion
    <br>6. France: $39.6 trillion
    <br>7. Italy: $37.2 trillion
    <br>8. Canada: $34.1 trillion
    <br>9. India: $33.6 trillion
    <br>10. Australia: $31.9 trillion
    <br>**Factors Driving Global Household Wealth Growth**
    <br>The strong growth in global household wealth in recent years has been driven by a number of factors, including:
    <br>* **Low interest rates:** Low interest rates have made it cheaper for households to borrow money, which has led to increased spending on investments such as homes and stocks.
    <br>* **Strong economic growth:** The global economy has been growing strongly in recent years, which has boosted household incomes and created more opportunities for wealth creation.
    <br>* **Rise of the middle class:** The middle class in many developing countries is growing rapidly, which is creating a new generation of wealthy households.
    <br>**Challenges to Future Growth**
    <br>While global household wealth is expected to continue to grow in the years to come, there are also a number of challenges that could slow down this growth. These include:
    <br>* **Rising interest rates:** Rising interest rates could make it more expensive for households to borrow money, which could dampen spending and investment.
    <br>* **Geopolitical instability:** Geopolitical instability, such as the war in Ukraine, could disrupt global trade and investment, which could also slow down economic growth.
    <br>* **Increasing inequality:** The gap between the rich and the poor is widening in many countries, which could lead to social unrest and political instability.
    <br>**Policy Implications**
    <br>Policymakers need to be aware of the challenges and opportunities facing global household wealth in order to develop policies that support sustainable and equitable economic growth. Some of the key policy areas that need to be addressed include:
    <br>* **Financial regulation:** Financial regulation can help to prevent excessive risk-taking and financial instability.
    <br>* **Tax policy:** Tax policy can be used to redistribute wealth and reduce inequality.
    <br>* **Education and training:** Education and training can help to create a skilled workforce that can contribute to economic growth.
    <br>It is important to note that these are just some of the many factors that will affect global household wealth in the years to come. The future of global wealth is uncertain, but it is clear that it will continue to be a major issue of interest and debate."

    <br>Household law, also known as domestic relations law, encompasses a wide range of legal issues that arise within the context of families and households. It deals with topics such as marriage, divorce, child custody, child support, adoption, domestic violence, and elder care.
    <br>
    <br>**Marriage**
    <br>Marriage is a legal union between two individuals, typically involving a ceremony and registration with a government authority. It establishes a number of legal rights and responsibilities for the spouses, including the right to inherit property from each other, the right to make medical decisions for each other if they are incapacitated, and the right to file joint tax returns.
    <br>
    <br>**Divorce**
    <br>Divorce is the legal termination of a marriage. It is a complex and emotionally charged process that can involve a variety of legal issues, such as the division of assets and debts, the custody of children, and the payment of spousal support.
    <br>
    <br>**Child Custody**
    <br>Child custody refers to the legal responsibility for the care and upbringing of a child. In a divorce or separation, the court will typically make a decision regarding the custody of the children. There are two main types of child custody:
    <br>* **Physical custody:** This refers to the child's primary residence.
    <br>* **Legal custody:** This refers to the decision-making authority regarding the child's education, healthcare, and other major life decisions.
    <br>The court will consider a variety of factors when making a custody decision, such as the wishes of the parents, the child's age and maturity, and the child's relationship with each parent.
    <br>
    <br>**Child Support**
    <br>Child support is a form of financial assistance paid by one parent to the other parent to help defray the costs of raising a child. The amount of child support is typically determined based on the parents' incomes and the child's needs.
    <br>
    <br>**Adoption**
    <br>Adoption is the legal process of creating a parent-child relationship between an adult and a child who is not their biological child. There are two main types of adoption:
    <br>* **Public adoption:** This is an adoption of a child who is in the care of the state.
    <br>* **Private adoption:** This is an adoption of a child who is not in the care of the state.
    <br>The adoption process is different for each type of adoption, but it typically involves a home study, background checks, and court hearings.
    <br>
    <br>**Domestic Violence**
    <br>Domestic violence is a pattern of abusive behavior that is used by one person to control and dominate another person in an intimate relationship. It can take many forms, including physical, emotional, sexual, and financial abuse.
    <br>There are a number of legal protections available to victims of domestic violence, including restraining orders, protective orders, and shelters.
    <br>
    <br>**Elder Care**
    <br>Elder care is the provision of assistance and support to older adults. This can include help with daily living tasks, such as bathing, dressing, and eating, as well as help with managing finances and healthcare.
    <br>There are a number of legal issues that can arise in the context of elder care, such as the power of attorney, guardianship, and elder abuse."

    <br>">family-law vs household-law:
    <br>It seems there might be a bit of confusion in your terms. Typically, the legal field uses the term "family law" to encompass legal issues related to family relationships, such as divorce, child custody, adoption, and spousal support.
    <br>
    <br>On the other hand, "household law" is not a standard legal term in most jurisdictions. It's possible that you may be referring to issues related to the management of a household, but these matters would generally fall under broader categories like property law or domestic relations.
    <br>
    <br>If you have a specific context or jurisdiction in mind, please provide more details, and I'll do my best to assist you."

    <br>">family-law vs household-law:
    <br>Family law and household law are two terms that are often used interchangeably, but they have slightly different meanings.
    <br>
    <br>**Family law** is a broad term that encompasses the legal rules and principles that govern the formation, dissolution, and modification of families. This includes matters such as marriage, divorce, child custody, adoption, and domestic violence. Family law is a complex and evolving field that is constantly being shaped by social changes and legal developments.
    <br>
    <br>**Household law** is a more narrow term that refers to the legal rules and principles that govern the internal affairs of households. This includes matters such as property ownership, inheritance rights, and financial obligations. Household law is often based on common law principles and is subject to less variation than family law.
    <br>
    <br>In practice, the distinction between family law and household law is not always clear-cut. Many family law matters have a direct impact on the internal affairs of households, and many household law disputes have implications for family relationships. However, the two areas of law are distinct in their focus and scope.
    <br>
    <br>Here is a table that summarizes the key differences between family law and household law:
    <br>| Feature | Family Law | Household Law |
    <br>| Scope | Broad | Narrow |
    <br>| Focus | Formation, dissolution, and modification of families | Internal affairs of households |
    <br>| Based on | Common law and statutory law | Common law |
    <br>| Variation | More variable | Less variable |
    <br>| Example disputes | Divorce, child custody, adoption, domestic violence | Property ownership, inheritance rights, financial obligations |
    <br>
    <br>I hope this helps!

    <br>"4.150 Households often coincide with families, but members of the same household do not necessarily have to belong to the same family so long as there is some sharing of resources and consumption.
    <br>Households may be of any size and take a wide variety of different forms in different societies or cultures depending on tradition, religion, education, climate, geography, history and other socio-economic factors.
    <br>The definition of a household that is adopted by survey statisticians familiar with the socio-economic conditions within a given country is likely to approximate closely to the concept of a household as defined in the SNA, although survey statisticians may add more precise, or operational, criteria within a particular country."

    <br>">family vs household:
    <br>**Family and household** are two fundamental social groups that often overlap but are distinct in important ways. Understanding the differences between these two concepts is crucial for comprehending the structure and dynamics of society.
    <br>**Family**
    <br>A family is a group of people who are related to each other, typically through blood, marriage, or adoption. Families provide a sense of belonging, identity, and support for their members. They play a critical role in socializing children, transmitting cultural values, and fostering emotional well-being.
    <br>**Household**
    <br>On the other hand, a household is a group of people who share a common residence. While a household may consist of a family, it can also include unrelated individuals who live together for reasons such as convenience, economic necessity, or shared interests.
    <br>**Key Differences**
    <br>The key differences between family and household can be summarized as follows:
    <br>* **Relationship:** Families are based on kinship ties, while households are based on cohabitation.
    <br>* **Social Function:** Families serve as a primary unit of socialization and emotional support, while households primarily fulfill practical needs like shared housing and expenses.
    <br>* **Structure:** Families can take various forms, including nuclear families, extended families, and single-parent families, while households typically consist of individuals who share a dwelling.
    <br>* **Size:** Families can range in size from two individuals to large extended families, while households typically have a smaller average size.
    <br>**Overlapping Concepts**
    <br>While family and household are distinct concepts, they often overlap. In many cases, families form the core of households, and households provide the physical and social space for families to thrive. However, this is not always the case. For instance, a household may include roommates who are not related to each other, or a family may be dispersed across multiple households due to factors such as work or education.
    <br>**Sociological Perspectives**
    <br>Sociologists have long studied the relationship between family and household, examining how these social groups shape individual and societal outcomes. They have explored how family structures influence child development, gender roles, and economic inequality. Additionally, sociologists have investigated the impact of household composition on factors such as social mobility, health outcomes, and political participation.
    <br>**Conclusion**
    <br>Understanding the differences and interrelationships between family and household is essential for comprehending the complexities of human society. These social groups play a fundamental role in shaping individual lives, societal norms, and the overall well-being of communities."

    <br>">household vs family:
    <br>The terms "household" and "family" are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct meanings, especially in sociological and statistical contexts:
    <br>1. **Household:** A household refers to all the people who occupy a housing unit, such as a house, apartment, or other living quarters. This includes everyone who lives there, regardless of their relationships to each other. A household can consist of a single person living alone, a family (which could include relatives and non-relatives), or a group of unrelated people. The key characteristic of a household is the shared living space and economic arrangements, like paying for rent or utilities together.
    <br>2. **Family:** A family, in a more traditional sense, refers to a group of people related by blood, marriage, or adoption. However, definitions of family can vary culturally and personally. In sociological terms, a family often involves emotional, economic, and social support for its members. It's a subset of a household, as not all households are made up of families. For example, a household might include roommates or lodgers who are not family members.
    <br>In summary, while all members of a family (in the traditional sense) can be part of a household, not all members of a household are necessarily part of a family. The distinction is particularly important in demographics, sociology, and legal contexts, where each term has specific implications and uses."

    <br>">timeline of households:
    <br>The concept of a household has evolved significantly over time, influenced by cultural, economic, and technological changes. Here's a brief timeline highlighting some key developments in the history of households:
    <br>### Prehistoric Times
    <br>- **Nomadic Lifestyle**: Early humans lived in small, nomadic groups, often in temporary shelters or caves.
    <br>- **Neolithic Revolution (around 10,000 BC)**: The advent of agriculture led to the formation of more permanent settlements.
    <br>### Ancient Civilizations (3000 BC - 5th Century AD)
    <br>- **Early Settlements**: The rise of civilizations in Mesopotamia, Egypt, Indus Valley, and later in Greece and Rome, saw the development of more structured households.
    <br>- **Patriarchal Structures**: Households were typically patriarchal, with the male head of the family managing the property and making decisions.
    <br>### Middle Ages (5th - 15th Century)
    <br>- **Feudal System**: In Europe, the feudal system dictated social and economic structures, with serfs living on their lord's land in small, simple houses.
    <br>- **Extended Families**: It was common for multiple generations to live under one roof.
    <br>### Renaissance to Industrial Revolution (15th - 18th Century)
    <br>- **Urbanization**: The growth of cities led to more diverse forms of households.
    <br>- **Nuclear Families**: In Western Europe, there was a gradual shift towards smaller, nuclear family units.
    <br>### 19th Century
    <br>- **Industrial Revolution**: Massive urbanization, people moved from rural areas to cities for work, changing the dynamics and size of households.
    <br>- **Colonial Influences**: European colonialism impacted family structures globally, with Western norms often imposed or adopted in colonized regions.
    <br>### 20th Century
    <br>- **World Wars**: The World Wars brought significant changes, including women entering the workforce in large numbers.
    <br>- **Post-War Period**: The mid-20th century saw a rise in the ideal of the suburban nuclear family, especially in the United States and Europe.
    <br>- **Social Changes**: The latter half of the 20th century witnessed significant shifts, with increased divorce rates and more single-parent households.
    <br>### 21st Century
    <br>- **Technological Impact**: The digital age has transformed households, with smart home technology and increased connectivity.
    <br>- **Diverse Family Structures**: There's now a wide recognition of diverse family structures, including single-person households, same-sex couples, and blended families.
    <br>- **Globalization**: Global influences are more pronounced, with migration and cultural exchanges shaping household forms.
    <br>This timeline provides a general overview, but it's important to note that household structures can vary widely based on cultural, regional, and individual factors."

    <br>">timeline of households:
    <br>**Timeline of Households**
    <br>The size and structure of households have changed significantly over time. Here's a timeline of some of the key changes:
    <br>**Prehistoric Era**
    <br>* **Hunter-gatherer bands:** Small, nomadic groups of 50-100 people who lived off hunting and gathering.
    <br>* **Agricultural villages:** Larger, more permanent settlements of 100-200 people who grew their own food.
    <br>**Ancient Era**
    <br>* **Extended families:** Households were typically extended families, with multiple generations living under one roof.
    <br>* **Slavery:** Slavery was common in many ancient societies, and slaves were often considered part of the household.
    <br>**Medieval Era**
    <br>* **Peasant households:** Most households were peasant households, consisting of a nuclear family and maybe a few servants.
    <br>* **Manorial system:** Peasants were bound to the land and worked for the lord of the manor in exchange for protection and a share of the crops.
    <br>**Early Modern Era**
    <br>* **Rise of the middle class:** The middle class grew in size and importance during this period, leading to the development of smaller and more nuclear households.
    <br>* **Protestant Reformation:** The Protestant Reformation led to changes in marriage and family law, which further contributed to the decline of extended families.
    <br>**19th century**
    <br>* **Industrial Revolution:** The Industrial Revolution led to a large-scale migration from rural areas to cities, which further reduced the size of households.
    <br>* **Rise of women's work:** More women started working outside the home in factories and other industries, which shifted the balance of power within households.
    <br>**20th century**
    <br>* **Two-income households:** More and more couples started both working outside the home, which led to further changes in family structure.
    <br>* **Rise of divorce:** Divorce rates increased dramatically during the 20th century.
    <br>* **Increased diversity of family structures:** Same-sex couples, single-parent households, and other non-traditional family structures became more common.
    <br>**21st century**
    <br>* **Continued rise of diversity:** Family structures continue to diversify, with new types of households emerging all the time.
    <br>* **Impact of technology:** Technology has played a major role in changing the way we live and work, which has also had an impact on households and family life.
    <br>**The future of households**
    <br>It's difficult to predict exactly what the future holds for households, but there are a few trends that are likely to continue:
    <br>* **Diversity:** Family structures will continue to diversify, with more and more people choosing to live in non-traditional households.
    <br>* **Technology:** Technology will continue to play an increasingly important role in our lives, which will have a significant impact on households and family life.
    <br>* **Flexibility:** People are becoming more flexible about how and where they live, which will lead to new forms of households and family arrangements."

    <br>">aggregate global households:
    <br>The term "aggregate global households" refers to the total number of households worldwide. According to the World Bank's 2023 data, there are approximately 4.9 billion households globally. This number is expected to grow to 5.8 billion by 2030.
    <br>There is significant variation in the number of households across different countries and regions. For example, in developed countries like the United States and Japan, there are an average of 2.5 persons per household, while in developing countries like India and Nigeria, the average is 4.3 and 4.7 persons per household, respectively.
    <br>The growth of global households is driven by a number of factors, including rising urbanization, increasing life expectancy, and changes in family structure. As more people move to cities, they typically form smaller households. At the same time, aging populations lead to more single-person households.
    <br>The growth of global households has a number of implications for the economy and society. It puts upward pressure on housing demand, which can lead to higher prices and make it more difficult for people to afford homes. It also puts pressure on infrastructure, such as education and healthcare systems.
    <br>However, the growth of global households also presents opportunities. With more households, there is a larger market for consumer goods and services. Additionally, the growing demand for labor from younger generations could help to alleviate labor shortages in many countries.
    <br>Overall, the growth of global households is a complex phenomenon with both positive and negative consequences. It is important to understand the factors driving this growth and to develop policies that can mitigate the negative impacts and maximize the benefits."

  <p id="idOznCsn009dsn">description::
    <br>"The cohousing model started a few decades ago in Europe, primarily in Denmark, Sweden, and the Netherlands. In this model, people rent or buy private homes in a defined neighborhood, but they share common green space and common indoor spaces. Indoor space typically includes a common house in which members of these communities may come together for meals at least a couple times a week. The cohousing community is run by the people who live there, which distinguishes it from other types of senior living. Cohousing is designed to promote social contact and has been proven to serve as an antidote to social isolation (Glass, 2016; Glass, 2020a). People who move into cohousing are those who want to take a participative role in shaping their lives; they are actively engaged, they make the decisions for the community, and mutual support is facilitated."

    <br>"Nonprofit senior housing cooperatives (ages 55 and older), in which members buy shares, are not new. The first was opened in 1978 in Minnesota, and the majority are still located in Minnesota (Fontaine, 2013; Sudo, 2019). The favorable financing provided through the Minnesota Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is one reason it has thrived here; this HUD office now processes all cooperative housing financing applications (Fontaine, 2013; Sudo, 2019). However, the idea is slowly spreading overall; the number of senior co-ops has increased from 103 in 2013 to 125 in 2019, and is expanding to other states (Sudo, 2019). Limited equity co-ops are the most common type, which aim to guarantee long-term affordability by limiting the resale price of shares, and are designed for adults of moderate income. In 2013, it was estimated that to purchase a share and reside in a senior co-op required an income between $18,000 and $37,000 per year (Fontaine, 2013)."

    <br>">commune household:
    <br>A commune or communal household refers to a living arrangement where a group of people share living spaces and resources, often with the goal of creating a close-knit community that lives together based on shared values, interests, or goals. This type of household can vary widely in size, structure, and purpose. Here are some common characteristics and aspects:
    <br>1. **Shared Spaces and Resources**: Members typically share common areas such as kitchens, living rooms, and gardens. They may also share responsibilities for household chores, cooking, and maintenance.
    <br>2. **Shared Values or Goals**: Communes are often formed around specific ideologies, lifestyles, or objectives. These can include sustainability, cooperative living, social change, spiritual practices, or simply the desire for a sense of community and belonging.
    <br>3. **Economic Sharing**: Many communes practice some form of economic sharing or collective ownership. This could involve pooling income, sharing expenses, or collectively owning property and assets.
    <br>4. **Decision-Making**: Communal households often employ democratic or consensus-based decision-making processes for matters affecting the group, ranging from financial decisions to household rules.
    <br>5. **Diversity**: Communes can vary greatly in terms of their social makeup, including families, singles, couples, and people of various ages, backgrounds, and orientations.
    <br>6. **Legal Structures**: The legal organization of a commune can vary, including cooperative housing, nonprofit organizations, or informal agreements among members.
    <br>7. **Challenges and Benefits**: Living in a communal household can offer a strong sense of community, shared responsibilities, and a more affordable lifestyle. However, it also requires compromise, open communication, and a commitment to collective living.
    <br>Communes have existed in various forms throughout history and across cultures, with a notable resurgence in the 1960s and 1970s as part of the counterculture movement. Today, they continue to appeal to those looking for alternative living arrangements that emphasize community and shared values over individualism."

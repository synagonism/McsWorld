  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtPreambleP1">This Agenda is a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity.
    <br>It also seeks to strengthen universal peace in larger freedom.
    <br>We recognise that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development.
    <br>All countries and all stakeholders, acting in collaborative partnership, will implement this plan.
    <br>We are resolved to free the human race from the tyranny of poverty and want and to heal and secure our planet.
    <br>We are determined to take the bold and transformative steps which are urgently needed to shift the world onto a sustainable and resilient path.
    <br>As we embark on this collective journey, we pledge that no one will be left behind.
    <br>The 17 Sustainable Development Goals and 169 targets which we are announcing today demonstrate the scale and ambition of this new universal Agenda.
    <br>They seek to build on the Millennium Development Goals and complete what these did not achieve.
    <br>They seek to realize the human rights of all and to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls.
    <br>They are integrated and indivisible and balance the three dimensions of sustainable development: the economic, social and environmental.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtPreambleP1"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtPreambleP2">The Goals and targets will stimulate action over the next fifteen years in areas of critical importance for humanity and the planet:

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtIntroductionH4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP1">1. We, the Heads of State and Government and High Representatives, meeting at the United Nations Headquarters in New York from 25-27 September 2015 as the Organization celebrates its seventieth anniversary, have decided today on new global Sustainable Development Goals.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP1"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP2">2. On behalf of the peoples we serve, we have adopted a historic decision on a comprehensive, far-reaching and people-centred set of universal and transformative Goals and targets.
    <br>We commit ourselves to working tirelessly for the full implementation of this Agenda by 2030.
    <br>We recognize that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development.
    <br>We are committed to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions – economic, social and environmental – in a balanced and integrated manner.
    <br>We will also build upon the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals and seek to address their unfinished business.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP2"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP3">3. We resolve, between now and 2030, to end poverty and hunger everywhere; to combat inequalities within and among countries; to build peaceful, just and inclusive societies; to protect human rights and promote gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; and to ensure the lasting protection of the planet and its natural resources.
    <br>We resolve also to create conditions for sustainable, inclusive and sustained economic growth, shared prosperity and decent work for all, taking into account different levels of national development and capacities.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP3"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP4">4. As we embark on this great collective journey, we pledge that no one will be left behind.
    <br>Recognizing that the dignity of the human person is fundamental, we wish to see the Goals and targets met for all nations and peoples and for all segments of society.
    <br>And we will endeavour to reach the furthest behind first.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP4"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP5">5. This is an Agenda of unprecedented scope and significance.
    <br>It is accepted by all countries and is applicable to all, taking into account different national realities, capacities and levels of development and respecting national policies and priorities.
    <br>These are universal goals and targets which involve the entire world, developed and developing countries alike.
    <br>They are integrated and indivisible and balance the three dimensions of sustainable development.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP5"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP6">6. The Goals and targets are the result of over two years of intensive public consultation and engagement with civil society and other stakeholders around the world, which paid particular attention to the voices of the poorest and most vulnerable.
    <br>This consultation included valuable work done by the General Assembly Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals and by the United Nations, whose Secretary-General provided a synthesis report in December 2014.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtOurvisionH4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP7">7. In these Goals and targets, we are setting out a supremely ambitious and transformational vision.
    <br>We envisage a world free of poverty, hunger, disease and want, where all life can thrive.
    <br>We envisage a world free of fear and violence.
    <br>A world with universal literacy.
    <br>A world with equitable and universal access to quality education at all levels, to health care and social protection, where physical, mental and social well-being are assured.
    <br>A world where we reaffirm our commitments regarding the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation and where there is improved hygiene; and where food is sufficient, safe, affordable and nutritious.
    <br>A world where human habitats are safe, resilient and sustainable and where there is universal access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP7"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP8">8. We envisage a world of universal respect for human rights and human dignity, the rule of law, justice, equality and non-discrimination; of respect for race, ethnicity and cultural diversity; and of equal opportunity permitting the full realization of human potential and contributing to shared prosperity.
    <br>A world which invests in its children and in which every child grows up free from violence and exploitation.
    <br>A world in which every woman and girl enjoys full gender equality and all legal, social and economic barriers to their empowerment have been removed.
    <br>A just, equitable, tolerant, open and socially inclusive world in which the needs of the most vulnerable are met.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP8"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP9">9. We envisage a world in which every country enjoys sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth and decent work for all.
    <br>A world in which consumption and production patterns and use of all natural resources – from air to land, from rivers, lakes and aquifers to oceans and seas - are sustainable.
    <br>One in which democracy, good governance and the rule of law as well as an enabling environment at national and international levels, are essential for sustainable development, including sustained and inclusive economic growth, social development, environmental protection and the eradication of poverty and hunger.
    <br>One in which development and the application of technology are climate-sensitive, respect biodiversity and are resilient.
    <br>One in which humanity lives in harmony with nature and in which wildlife and other living species are protected.

  <h4 id="idUn2030asdtxtOspacH4">Our shared principles and commitments
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtOspacH4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP10">10. The new Agenda is guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, including full respect for international law.
    <br>It is grounded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, international human rights treaties, the Millennium Declaration and the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document.
    <br>It is informed by other instruments such as the Declaration on the Right to Development.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP10"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP11">11. We reaffirm the outcomes of all major UN conferences and summits which have laid a solid foundation for sustainable development and have helped to shape the new Agenda.
    <br>These include the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development; the World Summit on Sustainable Development; the World Summit for Social Development; the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, the Beijing Platform for Action; and the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development ("Rio+ 20").
    <br>We also reaffirm the follow-up to these conferences, including the outcomes of the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, the Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States; the Second United Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing Countries; and the Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP11"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP12">12. We reaffirm all the principles of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, including, inter alia, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, as set out in principle 7 thereof.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP12"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP13">13. The challenges and commitments contained in these major conferences and summits are interrelated and call for integrated solutions.
    <br>To address them effectively, a new approach is needed.
    <br>Sustainable development recognizes that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, combatting inequality within and among countries, preserving the planet, creating sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth and fostering social inclusion are linked to each other and are interdependent.

  <section id="idUn2030asdtxtOurworldtoday">
  <h4 id="idUn2030asdtxtOurworldtodayH4">Our world today
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtOurworldtodayH4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP14">14. We are meeting at a time of immense challenges to sustainable development.
    <br>Billions of our citizens continue to live in poverty and are denied a life of dignity.
    <br>There are rising inequalities within and among countries.
    <br>There are enormous disparities of opportunity, wealth and power.
    <br>Gender inequality remains a key challenge.
    <br>Unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, is a major concern.
    <br>Global health threats, more frequent and intense natural disasters, spiralling conflict, violent extremism, terrorism and related humanitarian crises and forced displacement of people threaten to reverse much of the development progress made in recent decades.
    <br>Natural resource depletion and adverse impacts of environmental degradation, including desertification, drought, land degradation, freshwater scarcity and loss of biodiversity, add to and exacerbate the list of challenges which humanity faces.
    <br>Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time and its adverse impacts undermine the ability of all countries to achieve sustainable development.
    <br>Increases in global temperature, sea level rise, ocean acidification and other climate change impacts are seriously affecting coastal areas and low-lying coastal countries, including many least developed countries and small island developing States.
    <br>The survival of many societies, and of the biological support systems of the planet, is at risk.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP14"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP15">15. It is also, however, a time of immense opportunity.
    <br>Significant progress has been made in meeting many development challenges.
    <br>Within the past generation, hundreds of millions of people have emerged from extreme poverty.
    <br>Access to education has greatly increased for both boys and girls.
    <br>The spread of information and communications technology and global interconnectedness has great potential to accelerate human progress, to bridge the digital divide and to develop knowledge societies, as does scientific and technological innovation across areas as diverse as medicine and energy.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP15"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP16">16. Almost fifteen years ago, the Millennium Development Goals were agreed.
    <br>These provided an important framework for development and significant progress has been made in a number of areas.
    <br>But the progress has been uneven, particularly in Africa, least developed countries, landlocked developing countries, and small island developing States, and some of the MDGs remain off-track, in particular those related to maternal, newborn and child health and to reproductive health.
    <br>We recommit ourselves to the full realization of all the MDGs, including the off-track MDGs, in particular by providing focussed and scaled-up assistance to least developed countries and other countries in special situations, in line with relevant support programmes.
    <br>The new Agenda builds on the Millennium Development Goals and seeks to complete what these did not achieve, particularly in reaching the most vulnerable.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP16"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP17">17. In its scope, however, the framework we are announcing today goes far beyond the MDGs.
    <br>Alongside continuing development priorities such as poverty eradication, health, education and food security and nutrition, it sets out a wide range of economic, social and environmental objectives.
    <br>It also promises more peaceful and inclusive societies.
    <br>It also, crucially, defines means of implementation.
    <br>Reflecting the integrated approach that we have decided on, there are deep interconnections and many cross-cutting elements across the new Goals and targets.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP17"></a></p>

  <section id="idUn2030asdtxtThenewAgenda">
  <h4 id="idUn2030asdtxtThenewAgendaH4">The new Agenda
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtThenewAgendaH4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP18">18. We are announcing today 17 Sustainable Development Goals with 169 associated targets which are integrated and indivisible.
    <br>Never before have world leaders pledged common action and endeavour across such a broad and universal policy agenda.
    <br>We are setting out together on the path towards sustainable development, devoting ourselves collectively to the pursuit of global development and of "win-win" cooperation which can bring huge gains to all countries and all parts of the world.
    <br>We reaffirm that every State has, and shall freely exercise, full permanent sovereignty over all its wealth, natural resources and economic activity.
    <br>We will implement the Agenda for the full benefit of all, for today’s generation and for future generations.
    <br>In doing so, we reaffirm our commitment to international law and emphasize that the Agenda is to be implemented in a manner that is consistent with the rights and obligations of states under international law.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP18"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP19">19. We reaffirm the importance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as other international instruments relating to human rights and international law.
    <br>We emphasize the responsibilities of all States, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations, to respect, protect and promote human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction of any kind as to race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, disability or other status.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP19"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP20">20. Realizing gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls will make a crucial contribution to progress across all the Goals and targets.
    <br>The achievement of full human potential and of sustainable development is not possible if one half of humanity continues to be denied its full human rights and opportunities.
    <br>Women and girls must enjoy equal access to quality education, economic resources and political participation as well as equal opportunities with men and boys for employment, leadership and decision-making at all levels.
    <br>We will work for a significant increase in investments to close the gender gap and strengthen support for institutions in relation to gender equality and the empowerment of women at the global, regional and national levels.
    <br>All forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls will be eliminated, including through the engagement of men and boys.
    <br>The systematic mainstreaming of a gender perspective in the implementation of the Agenda is crucial.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP20"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP21">21. The new Goals and targets will come into effect on 1 January 2016 and will guide the decisions we take over the next fifteen years.
    <br>All of us will work to implement the Agenda within our own countries and at the regional and global levels, taking into account different national realities, capacities and levels of development and respecting national policies and priorities.
    <br>We will respect national policy space for sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, in particular for developing states, while remaining consistent with relevant international rules and commitments.
    <br>We acknowledge also the importance of the regional and sub-regional dimensions, regional economic integration and interconnectivity in sustainable development.
    <br>Regional and sub-regional frameworks can facilitate the effective translation of sustainable development policies into concrete action at national level.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP21"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP22">22. Each country faces specific challenges in its pursuit of sustainable development.
    <br>The most vulnerable countries and, in particular, African countries, least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing states deserve special attention, as do countries in situations of conflict and post-conflict countries.
    <br>There are also serious challenges within many middle-income countries.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP22"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP23">23. People who are vulnerable must be empowered.
    <br>Those whose needs are reflected in the Agenda include all children, youth, persons with disabilities (of whom more than 80% live in poverty), people living with HIV/AIDS, older persons, indigenous peoples, refugees and internally displaced persons and migrants.
    <br>We resolve to take further effective measures and actions, in conformity with international law, to remove obstacles and constraints, strengthen support and meet the special needs of people living in areas affected by complex humanitarian emergencies and in areas affected by terrorism.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP23"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP24">24. We are committed to ending poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including by eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
    <br>All people must enjoy a basic standard of living, including through social protection systems.
    <br>We are also determined to end hunger and to achieve food security as a matter of priority and to end all forms of malnutrition.
    <br>In this regard, we reaffirm the important role and inclusive nature of the Committee on World Food Security and welcome the Rome Declaration on Nutrition and Framework for Action.
    <br>We will devote resources to developing rural areas and sustainable agriculture and fisheries, supporting smallholder farmers, especially women farmers, herders and fishers in developing countries, particularly least developed countries.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP24"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP25">25. We commit to providing inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels – early childhood, primary, secondary, tertiary, technical and vocational training.
    <br>All people, irrespective of sex, age, race, ethnicity, and persons with disabilities, migrants, indigenous peoples, children and youth, especially those in vulnerable situations, should have access to life-long learning opportunities that help them acquire the knowledge and skills needed to exploit opportunities and to participate fully in society.
    <br>We will strive to provide children and youth with a nurturing environment for the full realization of their rights and capabilities, helping our countries to reap the demographic dividend including through safe schools and cohesive communities and families.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP25"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP26">26. To promote physical and mental health and well-being, and to extend life expectancy for all, we must achieve universal health coverage and access to quality health care.
    <br>No one must be left behind.
    <br>We commit to accelerating the progress made to date in reducing newborn, child and maternal mortality by ending all such preventable deaths before 2030.
    <br>We are committed to ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning, information and education.
    <br>We will equally accelerate the pace of progress made in fighting malaria, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, hepatitis, Ebola and other communicable diseases and epidemics, including by addressing growing anti-microbial resistance and the problem of unattended diseases affecting developing countries.
    <br>We are committed to the prevention and treatment of non-communicable diseases, including behavioural, developmental and neurological disorders, which constitute a major challenge for sustainable development.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP26"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP27">27. We will seek to build strong economic foundations for all our countries.
    <br>Sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth is essential for prosperity.
    <br>This will only be possible if wealth is shared and income inequality is addressed.
    <br>We will work to build dynamic, sustainable, innovative and people-centred economies, promoting youth employment and women’s economic empowerment, in particular, and decent work for all.
    <br>We will eradicate forced labour and human trafficking and end child labour in all its forms.
    <br>All countries stand to benefit from having a healthy and well-educated workforce with the knowledge and skills needed for productive and fulfilling work and full participation in society.
    <br>We will strengthen the productive capacities of least-developed countries in all sectors, including through structural transformation.
    <br>We will adopt policies which increase productive capacities, productivity and productive employment; financial inclusion; sustainable agriculture, pastoralist and fisheries development; sustainable industrial development; universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy services; sustainable transport systems; and quality and resilient infrastructure.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP27"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP28">28. We commit to making fundamental changes in the way that our societies produce and consume goods and services.
    <br>Governments, international organizations, the business sector and other non-state actors and individuals must contribute to changing unsustainable consumption and production patterns, including through the mobilization, from all sources, of financial and technical assistance to strengthen developing countries’ scientific, technological and innovative capacities to move towards more sustainable patterns of consumption and production.
    <br>We encourage the implementation of the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production.
    <br>All countries take action, with developed countries taking the lead, taking into account the development and capabilities of developing countries.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP28"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP29">29. We recognize the positive contribution of migrants for inclusive growth and sustainable development.
    <br>We also recognize that international migration is a multi-dimensional reality of major relevance for the development of countries of origin, transit and destination, which requires coherent and comprehensive responses.
    <br>We will cooperate internationally to ensure safe, orderly and regular migration involving full respect for human rights and the humane treatment of migrants regardless of migration status, of refugees and of displaced persons.
    <br>Such cooperation should also strengthen the resilience of communities hosting refugees, particularly in developing countries.
    <br>We underline the right of migrants to return to their country of citizenship, and recall that States must ensure that their returning nationals are duly received.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP29"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP30">30. States are strongly urged to refrain from promulgating and applying any unilateral economic, financial or trade measures not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations that impede the full achievement of economic and social development, particularly in developing countries.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP30"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP31">31. We acknowledge that the UNFCCC is the primary international, intergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to climate change.
    <br>We are determined to address decisively the threat posed by climate change and environmental degradation.
    <br>The global nature of climate change calls for the widest possible international cooperation aimed at accelerating the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions and addressing adaptation to the adverse impacts of climate change.
    <br>We note with grave concern the significant gap between the aggregate effect of Parties’ mitigation pledges in terms of global annual emissions of greenhouse gases by 2020 and aggregate emission pathways consistent with having a likely chance of holding the increase in global average temperature below 2 °C or 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP31"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP32">32. Looking ahead to the COP21 conference in Paris in December, we underscore the commitment of all States to work for an ambitious and universal climate agreement.
    <br>We reaffirm that the protocol, another legal instrument or agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all Parties shall address in a balanced manner, inter alia, mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity-building, and transparency of action and support.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP32"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP33">33. We recognise that social and economic development depends on the sustainable management of our planet’s natural resources.
    <br>We are therefore determined to conserve and sustainably use oceans and seas, freshwater resources, as well as forests, mountains and drylands and to protect biodiversity, ecosystems and wildlife.
    <br>We are also determined to promote sustainable tourism, tackle water scarcity and water pollution, to strengthen cooperation on desertification, dust storms, land degradation and drought and to promote resilience and disaster risk reduction.
    <br>In this regard, we look forward to COP13 of the Convention on Biological Diversity to be held in Mexico in 2016.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP33"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP34">34. We recognize that sustainable urban development and management are crucial to the quality of life of our people.
    <br>We will work with local authorities and communities to renew and plan our cities and human settlements so as to foster community cohesion and personal security and to stimulate innovation and employment.
    <br>We will reduce the negative impacts of urban activities and of chemicals which are hazardous for human health and the environment, including through the environmentally sound management and safe use of chemicals, the reduction and recycling of waste and more efficient use of water and energy.
    <br>And we will work to minimize the impact of cities on the global climate system.
    <br>We will also take account of population trends and projections in our national, rural and urban development strategies and policies.
    <br>We look forward to the upcoming United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development in Quito, Ecuador.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP34"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP35">35. Sustainable development cannot be realized without peace and security; and peace and security will be at risk without sustainable development.
    <br>The new Agenda recognizes the need to build peaceful, just and inclusive societies that provide equal access to justice and that are based on respect for human rights (including the right to development), on effective rule of law and good governance at all levels and on transparent, effective and accountable institutions.
    <br>Factors which give rise to violence, insecurity and injustice, such as inequality, corruption, poor governance and illicit financial and arms flows, are addressed in the Agenda.
    <br>We must redouble our efforts to resolve or prevent conflict and to support post-conflict countries, including through ensuring that women have a role in peace-building and state-building.
    <br>We call for further effective measures and actions to be taken, in conformity with international law, to remove the obstacles to the full realization of the right of self-determination of peoples living under colonial and foreign occupation, which continue to adversely affect their economic and social development as well as their environment.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP35"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP36">36. We pledge to foster inter-cultural understanding, tolerance, mutual respect and an ethic of global citizenship and shared responsibility.
    <br>We acknowledge the natural and cultural diversity of the world and recognize that all cultures and civilizations can contribute to, and are crucial enablers of, sustainable development.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP36"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP37">37. Sport is also an important enabler of sustainable development.
    <br>We recognize the growing contribution of sport to the realization of development and peace in its promotion of tolerance and respect and the contributions it makes to the empowerment of women and of young people, individuals and communities as well as to health, education and social inclusion objectives.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP37"></a></p>

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtMeansofImplementationH4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP39">39. The scale and ambition of the new Agenda requires a revitalized Global Partnership to ensure its implementation.
    <br>We fully commit to this.
    <br>This Partnership will work in a spirit of global solidarity, in particular solidarity with the poorest and with people in vulnerable situations.
    <br>It will facilitate an intensive global engagement in support of implementation of all the Goals and targets, bringing together Governments, the private sector, civil society, the United Nations system and other actors and mobilizing all available resources.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP39"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP40">40. The means of implementation targets under Goal 17 and under each SDG are key to realising our Agenda and are of equal importance with the other Goals and targets.
    <br>The Agenda, including the SDGs, can be met within the framework of a revitalized global partnership for sustainable development, supported by the concrete policies and actions as outlined in the outcome document of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, held in Addis Ababa from 13-16 July 2015.
    <br>We welcome the endorsement by the General Assembly of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, which is an integral part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
    <br>We recognize that the full implementation of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda is critical for the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals and targets.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP40"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP41">41. We recognize that each country has primary responsibility for its own economic and social development.
    <br>The new Agenda deals with the means required for implementation of the Goals and targets.
    <br>We recognize that these will include the mobilization of financial resources as well as capacity-building and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries on favourable terms, including on concessional and preferential terms, as mutually agreed.
    <br>Public finance, both domestic and international, will play a vital role in providing essential services and public goods and in catalyzing other sources of finance.
    <br>We acknowledge the role of the diverse private sector, ranging from micro-enterprises to cooperatives to multinationals, and that of civil society organizations and philanthropic organizations in the implementation of the new Agenda.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP41"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP42">42. We support the implementation of relevant strategies and programmes of action, including the Istanbul Declaration and Programme of Action, the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway, the Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2014-2024, and reaffirm the importance of supporting the African Union’s Agenda 2063 and the programme of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), all of which are integral to the new Agenda.
    <br>We recognize the major challenge to the achievement of durable peace and sustainable development in countries in conflict and post-conflict situations.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP42"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP43">43. We emphasize that international public finance plays an important role in complementing the efforts of countries to mobilize public resources domestically, especially in the poorest and most vulnerable countries with limited domestic resources.
    <br>An important use of international public finance, including ODA, is to catalyse additional resource mobilization from other sources, public and private.
    <br>ODA providers reaffirm their respective commitments, including the commitment by many developed countries to achieve the target of 0.7% of ODA/GNI to developing countries and 0.15% to 0.2% of ODA/GNI to least developed countries.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP43"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP44">44. We acknowledge the importance for international financial institutions to support, in line with their mandates, the policy space of each country, in particular developing countries.
    <br>We recommit to broadening and strengthening the voice and participation of developing countries – including African countries, least developed countries, land-locked developing countries, small-island developing States and middle-income countries – in international economic decision-making, norm-setting and global economic governance.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP44"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP45">45. We acknowledge also the essential role of national parliaments through their enactment of legislation and adoption of budgets and their role in ensuring accountability for the effective implementation of our commitments.
    <br>Governments and public institutions will also work closely on implementation with regional and local authorities, sub-regional institutions, international institutions, academia, philanthropic organisations, volunteer groups and others.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP45"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP46">46. We underline the important role and comparative advantage of an adequately resourced, relevant, coherent, efficient and effective UN system in supporting the achievement of the SDGs and sustainable development.
    <br>While stressing the importance of strengthened national ownership and leadership at country level, we express our support for the ongoing ECOSOC Dialogue on the longer-term positioning of the United Nations development system in the context of this Agenda.

    <br>To support accountability to our citizens, we will provide for systematic follow-up and review at the various levels, as set out in this Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.
    <br>The High Level Political Forum under the auspices of the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council will have the central role in overseeing follow-up and review at the global level.

    <br>Such data is key to decision-making.
    <br>Data and information from existing reporting mechanisms should be used where possible.
    <br>We agree to intensify our efforts to strengthen statistical capacities in developing countries, particularly African countries, least developed countries, landlocked developing countries, small island developing States and middle-income countries.

  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP49">49. Seventy years ago, an earlier generation of world leaders came together to create the United Nations.
    <br>From the ashes of war and division they fashioned this Organization and the values of peace, dialogue and international cooperation which underpin it.
    <br>The supreme embodiment of those values is the Charter of the United Nations.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP49"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP50">50. Today we are also taking a decision of great historic significance.
    <br>We resolve to build a better future for all people, including the millions who have been denied the chance to lead decent, dignified and rewarding lives and to achieve their full human potential.
    <br>We can be the first generation to succeed in ending poverty; just as we may be the last to have a chance of saving the planet.
    <br>The world will be a better place in 2030 if we succeed in our objectives.

  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP54">54. Following an inclusive process of intergovernmental negotiations, and based on the Proposal of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals, which includes a chapeau contextualising the latter, the following are the Goals and targets which we have agreed.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP54"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP55">55. The SDGs and targets are integrated and indivisible, global in nature and universally applicable, taking into account different national realities, capacities and levels of development and respecting national policies and priorities.
    <br>Targets are defined as aspirational and global, with each government setting its own national targets guided by the global level of ambition but taking into account national circumstances.
    <br>Each government will also decide how these aspirational and global targets should be incorporated in national planning processes, policies and strategies.
    <br>It is important to recognize the link between sustainable development and other relevant ongoing processes in the economic, social and environmental fields.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP55"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP56">56. In deciding upon these Goals and targets, we recognise that each country faces specific challenges to achieve sustainable development, and we underscore the special challenges facing the most vulnerable countries and, in particular, African countries, least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, as well as the specific challenges facing the middle-income countries.
    <br>Countries in situations of conflict also need special attention.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP56"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP57">57. We recognize that baseline data for several of the targets remain unavailable, and we call for increased support for strengthening data collection and capacity building in Member States, to develop national and global baselines where they do not yet exist.
    <br>We commit to addressing this gap in data collection so as to better inform the measurement of progress, in particular for those targets below which do not have clear numerical targets.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP57"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP58">58. We encourage ongoing efforts by states in other fora to address key issues which pose potential challenges to the implementation of our Agenda; and we respect the independent mandates of those processes.
    <br>We intend that the Agenda and its implementation would support, and be without prejudice to, those other processes and the decisions taken therein.

    <br>We will respect each country’s policy space and leadership to implement policies for poverty eradication and sustainable development, while remaining consistent with relevant international rules and commitments.
    <br>At the same time, national development efforts need to be supported by an enabling international economic environment, including coherent and mutually supporting world trade, monetary and financial systems, and strengthened and enhanced global economic governance.
    <br>Processes to develop and facilitate the availability of appropriate knowledge and technologies globally, as well as capacity-building, are also critical.
    <br>We commit to pursuing policy coherence and an enabling environment for sustainable development at all levels and by all actors, and to reinvigorating the global partnership for sustainable development.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP63"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP64">64. We support the implementation of relevant strategies and programmes of action, including the Istanbul Declaration and Programme of Action, the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway, the Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2014-2024, and reaffirm the importance of supporting the African Union’s Agenda 2063 and the programme of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), all of which are integral to the new Agenda.
    <br>We recognize the major challenge to the achievement of durable peace and sustainable development in countries in conflict and post-conflict situations.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP64"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP65">65. We recognize that middle-income countries still face significant challenges to achieve sustainable development.
    <br>In order to ensure that achievements made to date are sustained, efforts to address ongoing challenges should be strengthened through the exchange of experiences, improved coordination, and better and focused support of the United Nations Development System, the international financial institutions, regional organizations and other stakeholders.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP65"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP66">66. We underscore that, for all countries, public policies and the mobilization and effective use of domestic resources, underscored by the principle of national ownership, are central to our common pursuit of sustainable development, including achieving the sustainable development goals.
    <br>We recognize that domestic resources are first and foremost generated by economic growth, supported by an enabling environment at all levels.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP66"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP67">67. Private business activity, investment and innovation are major drivers of productivity, inclusive economic growth and job creation.
    <br>We acknowledge the diversity of the private sector, ranging from micro-enterprises to cooperatives to multinationals.
    <br>We call on all businesses to apply their creativity and innovation to solving sustainable development challenges.
    <br>We will foster a dynamic and well-functioning business sector, while protecting labour rights and environmental and health standards in accordance with relevant international standards and agreements and other on-going initiatives in this regard, such as the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the labour standards of ILO, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and key multilateral environmental agreements, for parties to those agreements.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP67"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP68">68. International trade is an engine for inclusive economic growth and poverty reduction, and contributes to the promotion of sustainable development.
    <br>We will continue to promote a universal, rules-based, open, transparent, predictable, inclusive, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system under the World Trade Organization (WTO), as well as meaningful trade liberalization.
    <br>We call on all WTO members to redouble their efforts to promptly conclude the negotiations on the Doha Development Agenda.
    <br>We attach great importance to providing trade-related capacity-building for developing countries, including African countries, least-developed countries, landlocked developing countries, small island developing states and middle-income countries, including for the promotion of regional economic integration and interconnectivity.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP68"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP69">69. We recognize the need to assist developing countries in attaining long-term debt sustainability through coordinated policies aimed at fostering debt financing, debt relief, debt restructuring and sound debt management, as appropriate.
    <br>Many countries remain vulnerable to debt crises and some are in the midst of crises, including a number of least developed countries, small-island developing States and some developed countries.
    <br>We reiterate that debtors and creditors must work together to prevent and resolve unsustainable debt situations.
    <br>Maintaining sustainable debt levels is the responsibility of the borrowing countries; however we acknowledge that lenders also have a responsibility to lend in a way that does not undermine a country’s debt sustainability.
    <br>We will support the maintenance of debt sustainability of those countries that have received debt relief and achieved sustainable debt levels.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP69"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP70">70. We hereby launch a Technology Facilitation Mechanism which was established by the Addis Ababa Action Agenda in order to support the sustainable development goals.
    <br>The Technology Facilitation Mechanism will be based on a multi-stakeholder collaboration between Member States, civil society, private sector, scientific community, United Nations entities and other stakeholders and will be composed of: a United Nations Interagency Task Team on Science, Technology and Innovation for the SDGs, a collaborative Multistakeholder Forum on Science, Technology and Innovation for the SDGs and an on-line platform.
    <br>
    <br>• The United Nations Interagency Task Team on Science, Technology and Innovation for the SDGs will promote coordination, coherence, and cooperation within the UN System on STI related matters, enhancing synergy and efficiency, in particular to enhance capacity-building initiatives.
    <br>The Task Team will draw on existing resources and will work with 10 representatives from the civil society, private sector, the scientific community, to prepare the meetings of the Multistakeholder Forum on Science, Technology and Innovation for the SDGs, as well as in the development and operationalization of the on-line platform, including preparing proposals for the modalities for the Forum and the on-line platform.
    <br>The 10 representatives will be appointed by the Secretary General, for periods of two years.
    <br>The Task Team will be open to the participation of all UN agencies, funds and programmes, and ECOSOC functional commissions and it will initially be composed by the entities that currently integrate the informal working group on technology facilitation, namely: UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, United Nations Environment Programme, UNIDO, United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNCTAD, International Telecommunication Union, WIPO and the World Bank.
    <br>• The on-line platform will be used to establish a comprehensive mapping of, and serve as a gateway for, information on existing STI initiatives, mechanisms and programmes, within and beyond the UN.
    <br>The on-line platform will facilitate access to information, knowledge and experience, as well as best practices and lessons learned, on STI facilitation initiatives and policies.
    <br>The online platform will also facilitate the dissemination of relevant open access scientific publications generated worldwide.
    <br>The on-line platform will be developed on the basis of an independent technical assessment which will take into account best practices and lessons learned from other initiatives, within and beyond the United Nations, in order to ensure that it will complement, facilitate access to and provide adequate information on existing STI platforms, avoiding duplications and enhancing synergies.
    <br>• The Multi-stakeholder Forum on Science Technology and Innovation for the SDGs will be convened once a year, for a period of two days, to discuss STI cooperation around thematic areas for the implementation of the SDGs, congregating all relevant stakeholders to actively contribute in their area of expertise.
    <br>The Forum will provide a venue for facilitating interaction, matchmaking and the establishment of networks between relevant stakeholders and multi- stakeholder partnerships in order to identify and examine technology needs and gaps, including on scientific cooperation, innovation and capacity building, and also in order to help facilitate development, transfer and dissemination of relevant technologies for the SDGs.
    <br>The meetings of the Forum will be convened by the President of the ECOSOC before the meeting of the High Level Political Forum under the auspices of ECOSOC or, alternatively, in conjunction with other fora or conferences, as appropriate, taking into account the theme to be considered and on the basis of a collaboration with the organizers of the other fora or conference.
    <br>The meetings of the Forum will be co-chaired by two Member States and will result in a summary of discussions elaborated by the two co-chairs, as an input to the meetings of the High Level Political Forum, in the context of the follow-up and review of the implementation of the Post-2015 Development Agenda.
    <br>• The meetings of the HLPF will be informed by the summary of the Multistakeholder Forum.
    <br>The themes for the subsequent Multistakeholder Forum on Science Technology and Innovation for the SDGs will be considered by the High Level Political Forum on sustainable development, taking into account expert inputs from the Task Team.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP70"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP71">71. We reiterate that this Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals and targets, including the means of implementation are universal, indivisible and interlinked.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtFuparH4"></a></h4>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP72">72. We commit to engage in systematic follow-up and review of implementation of this Agenda over the next fifteen years.
    <br>A robust, voluntary, effective, participatory, transparent and integrated follow-up and review framework will make a vital contribution to implementation and will help countries to maximize and track progress in implementing this Agenda in order to ensure that no one is left behind.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP72"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP73">73. Operating at the national, regional and global levels, it will promote accountability to our citizens, support effective international cooperation in achieving this Agenda and foster exchanges of best practices and mutual learning.
    <br>It will mobilize support to overcome shared challenges and identify new and emerging issues.
    <br>As this is a universal Agenda, mutual trust and understanding among all nations will be important.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP73"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP74">74. Follow-up and review processes at all levels will be guided by the following principles:
    <br>
    <br>a. They will be voluntary and country-led, will take into account different national realities, capacities and levels of development and will respect policy space and priorities. As national ownership is key to achieving sustainable development, the outcome from national level processes will be the foundation for reviews at regional and global levels, given that the global review will be primarily based on national official data sources.
    <br>b. They will track progress in implementing the universal Goals and targets, including the means of implementation, in all countries in a manner which respects their universal, integrated and interrelated nature and the three dimensions of sustainable development.
    <br>c. They will maintain a longer-term orientation, identify achievements, challenges, gaps and critical success factors and support countries in making informed policy choices. They will help mobilize the necessary means of implementation and partnerships, support the identification of solutions and best practices and promote coordination and effectiveness of the international development system.
    <br>d. They will be open, inclusive, participatory and transparent for all people and will support the reporting by all relevant stakeholders.
    <br>e. They will be people-centred, gender-sensitive, respect human rights and have a particular focus on the poorest, most vulnerable and those furthest behind.
    <br>f. They will build on existing platforms and processes, where these exist, avoid duplication and respond to national circumstances, capacities, needs and priorities. They will evolve over time, taking into account emerging issues and the development of new methodologies, and will minimize the reporting burden on national administrations.
    <br>g. They will be rigorous and based on evidence, informed by country-led evaluations and data which is high-quality, accessible, timely, reliable and disaggregated by income, sex, age, race, ethnicity, migration status, disability and geographic location and other characteristics relevant in national contexts.
    <br>h. They will require enhanced capacity-building support for developing countries, including the strengthening of national data systems and evaluation programs, particularly in African countries, LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs and middle-income countries.
    <br>i. They will benefit from the active support of the UN system and other multilateral institutions.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP74"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP75">75. The Goals and targets will be followed-up and reviewed using a set of global indicators.
    <br>These will be complemented by indicators at the regional and national levels which will be developed by member states, in addition to the outcomes of work undertaken for the development of the baselines for those targets where national and global baseline data does not yet exist.
    <br>The global indicator framework, to be developed by the Inter Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators, will be agreed by the UN Statistical Commission by March 2016 and adopted thereafter by the Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly, in line with existing mandates.
    <br>This framework will be simple yet robust, address all SDGs and targets including for means of implementation, and preserve the political balance, integration and ambition contained therein.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP75"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP76">76. We will support developing countries, particularly African countries, LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs, in strengthening the capacity of national statistical offices and data systems to ensure access to high-quality, timely, reliable and disaggregated data.
    <br>We will promote transparent and accountable scaling-up of appropriate public-private cooperation to exploit the contribution to be made by a wide range of data, including earth observation and geo-spatial information, while ensuring national ownership in supporting and tracking progress.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idUn2030asdtxtP76"></a></p>
  <p id="idUn2030asdtxtP77">77. We commit to fully engage in conducting regular and inclusive reviews of progress at sub-national, national, regional and global levels.
    <br>We will draw as far as possible on the existing network of follow-up and review institutions and mechanisms.
    <br>National reports will allow assessments of progress and identify challenges at the regional and global level.
    <br>Along with regional dialogues and global reviews, they will inform recommendations for follow-up at various levels.

    <br>It will facilitate sharing of experiences, including successes, challenges and lessons learned, and provide political leadership, guidance and recommendations for follow-up.
    <br>It will promote system-wide coherence and coordination of sustainable development policies.
    <br>It should ensure that the Agenda remains relevant and ambitious and should focus on the assessment of progress, achievements and challenges faced by developed and developing countries as well as new and emerging issues.

    <br>The HLPF will also be informed by the Global Sustainable Development Report, which shall strengthen the science-policy interface and could provide a strong evidence-based instrument to support policy-makers in promoting poverty eradication and sustainable development.
    <br>We invite the President of ECOSOC to conduct a process of consultations on the scope, methodology and frequency of the Report as well as its relation to the SDG Progress Report, the outcome of which should be reflected in the Ministerial Declaration of the HLPF session in 2016.

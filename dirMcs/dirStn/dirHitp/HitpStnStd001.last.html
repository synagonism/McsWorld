  <section id="idPreface_1">
  <h2 id="idPreface_1H2">The IASB
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idPreface_1H2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idPP1">P1 The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) was established in 2001 as part of the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) Foundation.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idPP1"></a></p>
  <p id="idPP2">P2 The objectives of the IASC Foundation and of the IASB are:
    <br>
    <br><span id="idPP2a">(a) to develop, in the public interest, a single set of high quality, understandable and enforceable global accounting standards that require high quality, transparent and comparable information in financial statements and other financial reporting to help participants in the world’s capital markets and other users make economic decisions;</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idPP2b">(b) to promote the use and rigorous application of those standards;</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idPP2c">(c) in fulfilling the objectives associated with (a) and (b), to take account of, as appropriate, the special needs of small and medium-sized entities and emerging economies; and</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idPP2d">(d) to bring about convergence of national accounting standards and International Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards to high quality solutions.</span>
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idPP2"></a></p>
  <p id="idPP3">P3 The governance of the IASC Foundation rests with 22 Trustees.  The Trustees’ responsibilities include appointing the members of the IASB and associated councils and committees, as well as securing financing for the organisation.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idPP3"></a></p>
  <p id="idPP4">P4 The IASB is the standard-setting body of the IASC Foundation.  From 1 July 2009 the IASB comprises fifteen members, increasing to sixteen members at a date no later than 1 July 2012.  Up to three may be part-time members.  The IASB is responsible for approving <a href="#idInternational-Financial-Reporting-Standards">International Financial Reporting Standards</a> (IFRSs, including Interpretations) and related documents, such as the <em>Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements</em>, exposure drafts and discussion documents.  Before the IASB began operations, International Accounting Standards (IASs) and related Interpretations were established by the Board of IASC, which came into existence on 29 June 1973.  By resolution of the IASB, IASs and related Interpretations remain applicable, with the same authority as IFRSs developed by the IASB, unless and until they are amended or withdrawn by the IASB.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idPP4"></a></p>

  <section id="idPreface_2">
  <h2 id="idPreface_2H2">International Financial Reporting Standards
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idPreface_2H2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idPP5">P5 	The IASB achieves its objectives primarily by developing and publishing IFRSs and promoting the use of those standards in <a class="clsPreview" href="#idgeneral-purpose-financial-statements">general purpose financial statements</a> and other financial reporting.  Other financial reporting comprises information provided outside <a class="clsPreview" href="#idfinancial-statements">financial statements</a> that assists in the interpretation of a complete set of financial statements or improves users’ ability to make efficient economic decisions.  The term ‘financial reporting’ encompasses general purpose financial statements plus other financial reporting.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idPP5"></a></p>
  <p id="idPP6">P6 IFRSs set out recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements dealing with transactions and other events and conditions that are important in general purpose financial statements. They may also set out such requirements for transactions, events and conditions that arise mainly in specific industries. IFRSs are based on the <em>Framework</em>, which addresses the concepts underlying the information presented in general purpose financial statements. The objective of the <em>Framework</em> is to facilitate the consistent and logical formulation of IFRSs.  It also provides a basis for the use of judgement in resolving accounting issues.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idPP6"></a></p>
  </section>

  <section id="idPreface_3">
  <h2 id="idPreface_3H2">General purpose financial statements
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idPreface_3H2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idPP7">P7 IFRSs are designed to apply to the general purpose financial statements and other financial reporting of all profit-oriented entities.  General purpose financial statements are directed towards the common information needs of a wide range of users, for example, shareholders, creditors, employees and the public at large. The objective of financial statements is to provide information about the <a class="clsPreview" href="#idfinancial-position">financial position</a>, <a class="clsPreview" href="#idperformance">performance</a> and <a class="clsPreview" href="#idcash-flows">cash flows</a> of an entity that is useful to those users in making economic decisions.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idPP7"></a></p>
  <p id="idPP8">P8 General purpose financial statements are those directed to general financial information needs of a wide range of users who are not in a position to demand reports tailored to meet their particular information needs.  General purpose financial statements include those that are presented separately or within another public document such as an annual report or a prospectus.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idPP8"></a></p>
  </section>

  <section id="idPreface_4">
  <h2 id="idPreface_4H2">The <em>IFRS for SMEs</em>
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idPreface_4H2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idPP9">P9 	The IASB also develops and publishes a separate standard intended to apply to the general purpose financial statements of, and other financial reporting by, entities that in many countries are referred to by a variety of terms, including <a class="clsPreview" href="#idsmall-and-medium-sized-entities">small and medium-sized entities</a> (SMEs), private entities, and non-publicly accountable entities.  That standard is the <em>International Financial Reporting Standard for Small and Medium-sized Entities (IFRS for SMEs)</em>.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idPP9"></a></p>
  <p id="idPP10">P10 The term small and medium-sized entities as used by the IASB is defined and explained in <a href="#idS1">Section 1</a> <em>Small and Medium-sized Entities</em>. Many jurisdictions around the world have developed their own definitions of SMEs for a broad range of purposes including prescribing financial reporting obligations.  Often those national or regional definitions include quantified criteria based on revenue, assets, employees or other factors.  Frequently, the term SMEs is used to mean or to include very small entities without regard to whether they publish general purpose financial statements for external users.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idPP10"></a></p>
  <p id="idPP11">P11 SMEs often produce financial statements only for the use of owner-managers or only for the use of tax authorities or other governmental authorities. Financial statements produced solely for those purposes are not necessarily general purpose financial statements.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idPP11"></a></p>
  <p id="idPP12">P12 Tax laws are specific to each jurisdiction, and the objectives of general purpose financial reports differ from the objectives of reporting taxable profit. Thus, financial statements prepared in conformity with the <em>IFRS for SMEs</em> are unlikely to comply fully with all of the measurements required by a jurisdiction’s tax laws and regulations. A jurisdiction may be able to lessen the ‘dual reporting burden’ on SMEs by structuring tax reports as reconciliations from the profit or loss determined in accordance with the <em>IFRS for SMEs</em> and by other means.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idPP12"></a></p>

  <section id="idPreface_5">
  <h2 id="idPreface_5H2">Authority of the <em>IFRS for SMEs</em>
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idPreface_5H2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idPP13">P13 Decisions on which entities are required or permitted to use the IASB’s standards rest with legislative and regulatory authorities and standard-setters in individual jurisdictions.  This is true for <a class="clsPreview" href="#idfull-IFRSs">full IFRSs</a> and for the <em>IFRS for SMEs</em>. However, a clear definition of the class of entity for which the <em>IFRS for SMEs</em> is intended—as set out in <a href="#idS1">Section 1</a> of the IFRS—is essential so that (a) the IASB can decide on the accounting and disclosure requirements that are appropriate for that class of entity and (b) the legislative and regulatory authorities, standard-setters, and reporting entities and their auditors will be informed of the intended scope of applicability of the <em>IFRS for SMEs</em>. A clear definition is also essential so that entities that are not small or medium-sized entities, and therefore are not eligible to use the <em>IFRS for SMEs</em>, do not assert that they are in compliance with it (see <a class="clsPreview" href="#idP1_5">paragraph 1.5</a>).
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idPP13"></a></p>
  </section>

  <section id="idPreface_6">
  <h2 id="idPreface_6H2">Organisation of the <em>IFRS for SMEs</em>
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idPreface_6H2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idPP14">P14 The <em>IFRS for SMEs</em> is organised by topic, with each topic presented in a separate numbered section.  Cross-references to paragraphs are identified by section number followed by paragraph number.  Paragraph numbers are in the form xx.yy, where xx is the section number and yy is the sequential paragraph number within that section. In examples that include monetary amounts, the measuring unit is Currency Units (abbreviated as CU).
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idPP14"></a></p>
  <p id="idPP15">P15 All of the paragraphs in the IFRS have equal authority.  Some sections include appendices of implementation guidance that are not part of the IFRS but, rather, are guidance for applying it.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idPP15"></a></p>
  </section>

  <section id="idPreface_7">
  <h2 id="idPreface_7H2">Maintenance of the <em>IFRS for SMEs</em>
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idPreface_7H2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idPP16">P16 The IASB expects to undertake a thorough review of SMEs’ experience in applying the <em>IFRS for SMEs</em> when two years of financial statements using the IFRS have been published by a broad range of entities.  The IASB expects to propose amendments to address implementation issues identified in that review.  It will also consider new and amended IFRSs that have been adopted since the IFRS was issued.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idPP16"></a></p>
  <p id="idPP17">P17 After that initial implementation review, the IASB expects to propose amendments to the <em>IFRS for SMEs</em> by publishing an omnibus exposure draft approximately once every three years.  In developing those exposure drafts, it expects to consider new and amended IFRSs that have been adopted in the previous three years as well as specific issues that have been brought to its attention regarding possible amendments to the <em>IFRS for SMEs</em>. The IASB intends the three-year cycle to be a tentative plan, not a firm commitment.  On occasion, it may identify a matter for which amendment of the <em>IFRS for SMEs</em> may need to be considered earlier than in the normal three-year cycle.  Until the <em>IFRS for SMEs</em> is amended, any changes that the IASB may make or propose with respect to full IFRSs do not apply to the <em>IFRS for SMEs</em>.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idPP17"></a></p>
  <p id="idPP18">P18 The IASB expects that there will be a period of at least one year between when amendments to the <em>IFRS for SMEs</em> are issued and the effective date of those amendments.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idS1_2H2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idP1_2">1.2 Small and medium-sized entities are entities that:
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP1_2a">(a) do not have <a class="clsPreview" href="#idpublic-accountability">public accountability</a>, and</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP1_2b">(b) publish <a class="clsPreview" href="#idgeneral-purpose-financial-statements">general purpose financial statements</a> for external users.  Examples of external users include owners who are not involved in managing the business, existing and potential creditors, and credit rating agencies.</span>
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idP1_2"></a></p>
  <p id="idP1_3">1.3 An entity has public accountability if:
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP1_3a">(a) its debt or equity instruments are traded in a public market or it is in the process of issuing such instruments for trading in a public market (a domestic or foreign stock exchange or an over-the-counter market, including local and regional markets), or</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP1_3b">(b) it holds assets in a fiduciary capacity for a broad group of outsiders as one of its primary businesses.  This is typically the case for banks, credit unions, insurance companies, securities brokers/dealers, mutual funds and investment banks.</span>
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idP1_3"></a></p>
  <p id="idP1_4">1.4 Some entities may also hold assets in a fiduciary capacity for a broad group of outsiders because they hold and manage financial resources entrusted to them by clients, customers or members not involved in the management of the entity. However, if they do so for reasons incidental to a primary business (as, for example, may be the case for travel or real estate agents, schools, charitable organisations, co-operative enterprises requiring a nominal membership deposit, and sellers that receive payment in advance of delivery of the goods or services such as utility companies), that does not make them publicly accountable.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idP1_4"></a></p>
  <p id="idP1_5">1.5 If a publicly accountable entity uses this IFRS, its financial statements shall not be described as conforming to the <em>IFRS for SMEs</em>—even if law or regulation in its jurisdiction permits or requires this IFRS to be used by publicly accountable entities.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idP1_5"></a></p>

If its financial statements are described as conforming to the <em>IFRS for SMEs</em>, it must comply with all of the provisions of this IFRS.

The statement of cash flows provides information about the changes in <a class="clsPreview" href="#idcash">cash</a> and <a class="clsPreview" href="#idcash-equivalent">cash equivalents</a> of an entity for a <a class="clsPreview" href="#idreporting-period">reporting period</a>, showing separately changes from <a class="clsPreview" href="#idoperating-activities">operating activities</a>, <a class="clsPreview" href="#idinvesting-activities">investing activities</a> and <a class="clsPreview" href="#idfinancing-activities">financing activities</a>.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idS7_2H2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idP7_2">7.2 <a class="clsPreview" href="#idcash-equivalent">Cash equivalents</a> are short-term, highly liquid investments held to meet short-term cash commitments rather than for investment or other purposes. Therefore, an investment normally qualifies as a cash equivalent only when it has a short maturity of, say, three months or less from the date of acquisition. Bank overdrafts are normally considered financing activities similar to borrowings. However, if they are repayable on demand and form an integral part of an entity’s cash management, bank overdrafts are a component of cash and cash equivalents.

  <h3 id="idS7_3_1H3">Operating activities
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idS7_3_1H3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idP7_4">7.4 Operating activities are the principal <a class="clsPreview" href="#idrevenue">revenue</a>-producing activities of the entity. Therefore, cash flows from operating activities generally result from the transactions and other events and conditions that enter into the determination of <a class="clsPreview" href="#idprofit-or-loss">profit or loss</a>. Examples of cash flows from operating activities are:
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP7_4a">(a) cash receipts from the sale of goods and the rendering of services.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP7_4b">(b) cash receipts from royalties, fees, commissions and other revenue.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP7_4c">(c) cash payments to suppliers for goods and services.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP7_4d">(d) cash payments to and on behalf of employees.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP7_4e">(e) cash payments or refunds of income tax, unless they can be specifically identified with financing and investing activities.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP7_4f">(f) cash receipts and payments from investments, loans and other contracts held for dealing or trading purposes, which are similar to inventory acquired specifically for resale.</span>
    <br>
    <br>Some transactions, such as the sale of an item of plant by a manufacturing entity, may give rise to a gain or loss that is included in profit or loss.  However, the cash flows relating to such transactions are cash flows from investing activities.

  <p id="idP7_5">7.5 Investing activities are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents.  Examples of cash flows arising from investing activities are:
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP7_5a">(a) cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment (including self-constructed property, plant and equipment), intangible assets and other long-term assets.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP7_5b">(b) cash receipts from sales of property, plant and equipment, intangibles and other long-term assets.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP7_5c">(c) cash payments to acquire equity or debt instruments of other entities and interests in joint ventures (other than payments for those instruments classified as cash equivalents or held for dealing or trading).</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP7_5d">(d) cash receipts from sales of equity or debt instruments of other entities and interests in joint ventures (other than receipts for those instruments classified as cash equivalents or held for dealing or trading).</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP7_5e">(e) cash advances and loans made to other parties.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP7_5f">(f) cash receipts from the repayment of advances and loans made to other parties.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP7_5g">(g) cash payments for futures contracts, forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts, except when the contracts are held for dealing or trading, or the payments are classified as financing activities.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP7_5h">(h) cash receipts from futures contracts, forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts, except when the contracts are held for dealing or trading, or the receipts are classified as financing activities.</span>
    <br>
    <br>When a contract is accounted for as a hedge (see <a href="#idS12">Section 12</a> <em>Other Financial Instruments Issues</em>), an entity shall classify the cash flows of the contract in the same manner as the cash flows of the item being hedged.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idS11_8_1H3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idP11_15">11.15 The amortised cost of a financial asset or financial liability at each reporting date is the net of the following amounts:
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP11_15a">(a) the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition,</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP11_15b">(b) minus any repayments of the principal,</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP11_15c">(c) plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between the amount at initial recognition and the maturity amount,</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP11_15d">(d) minus, in the case of a financial asset, any reduction (directly or through the use of an allowance account) for impairment or uncollectibility.</span>
    <br>
    <br>Financial assets and financial liabilities that have no stated interest rate and are classified as current assets or current liabilities are initially measured at an undiscounted amount in accordance with <a class="clsPreview" href="#idP11_14a">paragraph 11.14(a)</a>.  Therefore, (c) above does not apply to them.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idP11_15"></a></p>
  <p id="idP11_16">11.16 The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or a financial liability (or a group of financial assets or financial liabilities) and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period.  The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability.  The effective interest rate is determined on the basis of the carrying amount of the financial asset or liability at initial recognition.  Under the effective interest method:
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP11_16a">(a) the amortised cost of a financial asset (liability) is the present value of future cash receipts (payments) discounted at the effective interest rate, and</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP11_16b">(b) the interest expense (income) in a period equals the carrying amount of the financial liability (asset) at the beginning of a period multiplied by the effective interest rate for the period.</span>
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idP11_16"></a></p>
  <p id="idP11_17">11.17 When calculating the effective interest rate, an entity shall estimate cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument (eg prepayment, call and similar options) and known credit losses that have been incurred, but it shall not consider possible future credit losses not yet incurred.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idP11_17"></a></p>
  <p id="idP11_18">11.18 When calculating the effective interest rate, an entity shall amortise any related fees, finance charges paid or received (such as ‘points’), transaction costs and other premiums or discounts over the expected life of the instrument, except as follows.  The entity shall use a shorter period if that is the period to which the fees, finance charges paid or received, transaction costs, premiums or discounts relate. This will be the case when the variable to which the fees, finance charges paid or received, transaction costs, premiums or discounts relate is repriced to market rates before the expected maturity of the instrument. In such a case, the appropriate amortisation period is the period to the next such repricing date.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idP11_18"></a></p>
  <p id="idP11_19">11.19 For variable rate financial assets and variable rate financial liabilities, periodic re-estimation of cash flows to reflect changes in market rates of interest alters the effective interest rate.  If a variable rate financial asset or variable rate financial liability is recognised initially at an amount equal to the principal receivable or payable at maturity, re-estimating the future interest payments normally has no significant effect on the carrying amount of the asset or liability.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idP11_19"></a></p>
  <p id="idP11_20">11.20 If an entity revises its estimates of payments or receipts, the entity shall adjust the carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability (or group of financial instruments) to reflect actual and revised estimated cash flows. The entity shall recalculate the carrying amount by computing the present value of estimated future cash flows at the financial instrument’s original effective interest rate. The entity shall recognise the adjustment as income or expense in profit or loss at the date of the revision.

  <p class="border-indent">Example – transfer that qualifies for derecognition
    <br>
    <br>An entity sells a group of its accounts receivable to a bank at less than their face amount.  The entity continues to handle collections from the debtors on behalf of the bank, including sending monthly statements, and the bank pays the entity a market-rate fee for servicing the receivables. The entity is obliged to remit promptly to the bank any and all amounts collected, but it has no obligation to the bank for slow payment or non-payment by the debtors. In this case, the entity has transferred to the bank substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the receivables.  Accordingly, it removes the receivables from its statement of financial position (ie derecognises them), and it shows no liability in respect of the proceeds received from the bank.  The entity recognises a loss calculated as the difference between the carrying amount of the receivables at the time of sale and the proceeds received from the bank. The entity recognises a liability to the extent that it has collected funds from the debtors but has not yet remitted them to the bank.
    </p>
  <p class="border-indent">Example – transfer that does not qualify for derecognition
    <br>
    <br>The facts are the same as the preceding example except that the entity has agreed to buy back from the bank any receivables for which the debtor is in arrears as to principal or interest for more than 120 days.  In this case, the entity has retained the risk of slow payment or non-payment by the debtors—a significant risk with respect to receivables.  Accordingly, the entity does not treat the receivables as having been sold to the bank, and it does not derecognise them.  Instead, it treats the proceeds from the bank as a loan secured by the receivables.  The entity continues to recognise the receivables as an asset until they are collected or written off as uncollectible.

    <br>
    <br>Foreign exchange risk of a debt instrument measured at amortised cost is not in the list above because hedge accounting would not have any significant effect on the financial statements.

Therefore, both the change in fair value of the hedging instrument (the cross-currency swap) and the change in the carrying amount of the payable relating to the change in the exchange rate would be recognised in profit or loss and should offset each other except to the extent of the difference between the spot rate (at which the liability is measured) and the forward rate (at which the swap is measured).

  <h2 id="idS13_4H2">Costs of purchase
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idS13_4H2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idP13_6">13.6 The costs of purchase of inventories comprise the purchase price, import duties and other taxes (other than those subsequently recoverable by the entity from the taxing authorities), and transport, handling and other costs directly attributable to the acquisition of finished goods, materials and services.  Trade discounts, rebates and other similar items are deducted in determining the costs of purchase.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idP13_6"></a></p>
  <p id="idP13_7">13.7 An entity may purchase inventories on deferred settlement terms.  In some cases, the arrangement effectively contains an unstated financing element, for example, a difference between the purchase price for normal credit terms and the deferred settlement amount. In these cases, the difference is recognised as interest expense over the period of the financing and is not added to the cost of the inventories.

  <h2 id="idS13_5H2">Costs of conversion
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idS13_5H2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idP13_8">13.8 The costs of conversion of inventories include costs directly related to the units of production, such as direct labour.  They also include a systematic allocation of fixed and variable production overheads that are incurred in converting materials into finished goods. Fixed production overheads are those indirect costs of production that remain relatively constant regardless of the volume of production, such as depreciation and maintenance of factory buildings and equipment, and the cost of factory management and administration.  Variable production overheads are those indirect costs of production that vary directly, or nearly directly, with the volume of production, such as indirect materials and indirect labour.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idS13_6H2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idP13_9">13.9 An entity shall allocate fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion on the basis of the normal capacity of the production facilities.  Normal capacity is the production expected to be achieved on average over a number of periods or seasons under normal circumstances, taking into account the loss of capacity resulting from planned maintenance.  The actual level of production may be used if it approximates normal capacity.  The amount of fixed overhead allocated to each unit of production is not increased as a consequence of low production or idle plant.  Unallocated overheads are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.  In periods of abnormally high production, the amount of fixed overhead allocated to each unit of production is decreased so that inventories are not measured above cost.  Variable production overheads are allocated to each unit of production on the basis of the actual use of the production facilities.

  <p id="idP13_10">13.10 A production process may result in more than one product being produced simultaneously.  This is the case, for example, when joint products are produced or when there is a main product and a by-product.  When the costs of raw materials or conversion of each product are not separately identifiable, an entity shall allocate them between the products on a rational and consistent basis. The allocation may be based, for example, on the relative sales value of each product either at the stage in the production process when the products become separately identifiable, or at the completion of production.  Most by-products, by their nature, are immaterial.  When this is the case, the entity shall measure them at selling price less costs to complete and sell and deduct this amount from the cost of the main product. As a result, the <a class="clsPreview" href="#idcarrying-amount">carrying amount</a> of the main product is not materially different from its cost.

These costs consist primarily of the labour and other costs of personnel directly engaged in providing the service, including supervisory personnel, and attributable overheads. Labour and other costs relating to sales and general administrative personnel are not included but are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.  The cost of inventories of a service provider does not include profit margins or non-attributable overheads that are often factored into prices charged by service providers.

  <p id="idP13_16">13.16 An entity may use techniques such as the standard cost method, the retail method or most recent purchase price for measuring the cost of inventories if the result approximates cost.  Standard costs take into account normal levels of materials and supplies, labour, efficiency and capacity utilisation.  They are regularly reviewed and, if necessary, revised in the light of current conditions.  The retail method measures cost by reducing the sales value of the inventory by the appropriate percentage gross margin.

Although potential voting rights are considered in deciding whether significant influence exists, an investor shall measure its share of profit or loss of the associate and its share of changes in the associate’s equity on the basis of present ownership interests.  Those measurements shall not reflect the possible exercise or conversion of potential voting rights..</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP14_8c">(c) <em>Implicit goodwill and fair value adjustments</em>. On acquisition of the investment in an associate, an investor shall account for any difference (whether positive or negative) between the cost of acquisition and the investor’s share of the fair values of the net identifiable assets of the associate in accordance with <a class="clsPreview" href="#idP19_22">paragraphs 19.22</a>–19.24.  An investor shall adjust its share of the associate’s profits or losses after acquisition to account for additional depreciation or amortisation of the associate’s depreciable or amortisable assets (including goodwill) on the basis of the excess of their fair values over their carrying amounts at the time the investment was acquired.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP14_8d">(d) <em>Impairment</em>.  If there is an indication that an investment in an associate may be impaired, an investor shall test the entire carrying amount of the investment for impairment in accordance with <a href="#idS27">Section 27</a> as a single asset. Any goodwill included as part of the carrying amount of the investment in the associate is not tested separately for impairment but, rather, as part of the test for impairment of the investment as a whole.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP14_8e">(e) <em>Investor’s transactions with associates</em>.  If an associate is accounted for using the equity method, the investor shall eliminate unrealised profits and losses resulting from upstream (associate to investor) and downstream (investor to associate) transactions to the extent of the investor’s interest in the associate. Unrealised losses on such transactions may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP14_8f">(f) <em>Date of associate’s financial statements</em>. In applying the equity method, the investor shall use the financial statements of the associate as of the same date as the financial statements of the investor unless it is <a class="clsPreview" href="#idimpracticable">impracticable</a> to do so.  If it is impracticable, the investor shall use the most recent available financial statements of the associate, with adjustments made for the effects of any significant transactions or events occurring between the accounting period ends.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP14_8g">(g) <em>Associate’s accounting policies</em>. If the associate uses accounting policies that differ from those of the investor, the investor shall adjust the associate’s financial statements to reflect the investor’s accounting policies for the purpose of applying the equity method unless it is impracticable to do so.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP14_8h">(h) <em>Losses in excess of investment</em>. If an investor’s share of losses of an associate equals or exceeds the carrying amount of its investment in the associate, the investor shall discontinue recognising its share of further losses.  After the investor’s interest is reduced to zero, the investor shall recognise additional losses by a provision (see <a href="#idS21">Section 21</a> <em>Provisions and Contingencies</em>) only to the extent that the investor has incurred legal or constructive obligations or has made payments on behalf of the associate. If the associate subsequently reports profits, the investor shall resume recognising its share of those profits only after its share of the profits equals the share of losses not recognised.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span class="clsIndent">(i) <em>Discontinuing the equity method</em>. An investor shall cease using the equity method from the date that significant influence ceases.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span class="clsIndent">(i) If the associate becomes a subsidiary or joint venture, the investor shall remeasure its previously held equity interest to fair value and recognise the resulting gain or loss, if any, in profit or loss.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span class="clsIndent">(ii) If an investor loses significant influence over an associate as a result of a full or partial disposal, it shall derecognise that associate and recognise in profit or loss the difference between, on the one hand, the sum of the proceeds received plus the fair value of any retained interest and, on the other hand, the carrying amount of the investment in the associate at the date significant influence is lost. Thereafter, the investor shall account for any retained interest using <a href="#idS11">Section 11</a> <em>Basic Financial Instruments</em> and <a href="#idS12">Section 12</a> <em>Other Financial Instruments Issues</em>, as appropriate.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span class="clsIndent">(iii) If an investor loses significant influence for reasons other than a partial disposal of its investment, the investor shall regard the carrying amount of the investment at that date as a new cost basis and shall account for the investment using Sections 11 and 12, as appropriate.</span>

It also incurs its own expenses and liabilities and raises its own finance, which represent its own obligations.  The joint venture activities may be carried out by the venturer’s employees alongside the venturer’s similar activities.  The joint venture agreement usually provides a means by which the revenue from the sale of the joint product and any expenses incurred in common are shared among the venturers.

  <p id="idP19_16">19.16 The acquirer’s statement of comprehensive income shall incorporate the acquiree’s profits and losses after the acquisition date by including the acquiree’s income and expenses based on the cost of the business combination to the acquirer.  For example, depreciation expense included after the acquisition date in the acquirer’s statement of comprehensive income that relates to the acquiree’s depreciable assets shall be based on the fair values of those depreciable assets at the acquisition date, ie their cost to the acquirer.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idP19_16"></a></p>
  <p id="idP19_17">19.17 Application of the purchase method starts from the acquisition date, which is the date on which the acquirer obtains control of the acquiree.  Because control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity or business so as to obtain benefits from its activities, it is not necessary for a transaction to be closed or finalised at law before the acquirer obtains control.  All pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding a business combination shall be considered in assessing when the acquirer has obtained control.

  <p id="idP19_19">19.19 If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the acquirer shall recognise in its financial statements provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete.

  <h2 id="idS20_2H2">Classification of leases
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idS20_2H2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idP20_4">20.4 A lease is classified as a <a class="clsPreview" href="#idfinance-lease">finance lease</a> if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership.  A lease is classified as an <a class="clsPreview" href="#idoperating-lease">operating lease</a> if it does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idP20_4"></a></p>
  <p id="idP20_5">20.5 Whether a lease is a finance lease or an operating lease depends on the substance of the transaction rather than the form of the contract.  Examples of situations that individually or in combination would normally lead to a lease being classified as a finance lease are:
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP20_5a">(a) the lease transfers ownership of the asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP20_5b">(b) the lessee has the option to purchase the asset at a price that is expected to be sufficiently lower than the <a class="clsPreview" href="#idfair-value">fair value</a> at the date the option becomes exercisable for it to be reasonably certain, at the inception of the lease, that the option will be exercised.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP20_5c">(c) the lease term is for the major part of the economic life of the asset even if title is not transferred.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP20_5d">(d) at the inception of the lease the <a class="clsPreview" href="#idpresent-value">present value</a> of the minimum lease payments amounts to at least substantially all of the fair value of the leased asset.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP20_5e">(e) the leased assets are of such a specialised nature that only the lessee can use them without major modifications.</span>
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idP20_5"></a></p>
  <p id="idP20_6">20.6 Indicators of situations that individually or in combination could also lead to a lease being classified as a finance lease are:
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP20_6a">(a) if the lessee can cancel the lease, the lessor’s losses associated with the cancellation are borne by the lessee.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP20_6b">(b) gains or losses from the fluctuation in the <a class="clsPreview" href="#idresidual-value">residual value</a> of the leased asset accrue to the lessee (eg in the form of a rent rebate equalling most of the sales proceeds at the end of the lease).</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP20_6c">(c) the lessee has the ability to continue the lease for a secondary period at a rent that is substantially lower than market rent.</span>
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idP20_6"></a></p>
  <p id="idP20_7">20.7 The examples and indicators in <a class="clsPreview" href="#idP20_5">paragraphs 20.5</a> and 20.6 are not always conclusive. If it is clear from other features that the lease does not transfer substantially all risks and rewards incidental to ownership, the lease is classified as an operating lease.  For example, this may be the case if ownership of the asset is transferred to the lessee at the end of the lease for a variable payment equal to the asset’s then fair value, or if there are contingent rents, as a result of which the lessee does not have substantially all risks and rewards incidental to ownership.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idP20_7"></a></p>
  <p id="idP20_8">20.8 Lease classification is made at the inception of the lease and is not changed during the term of the lease unless the lessee and the lessor agree to change the provisions of the lease (other than simply by renewing the lease), in which case the lease classification shall be re-evaluated.

    <br>X operates in a jurisdiction in which the consensus forecast by local banks is that the general price level index, as published by the government, will increase by an average of 10 per cent annually over the next five years.  X leases some office space from Y for five years under an operating lease.  The lease payments are structured to reflect the expected 10 per cent annual general inflation over the five-year term of the lease as follows
    <br>
    <br>Year 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CU100,000
    <br>Year 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CU110,000
    <br>Year 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CU121,000
    <br>Year 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CU133,000
    <br>Year 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CU146,000
    <br>
    <br>X recognises annual rent expense equal to the amounts owed to the lessor as shown above.  If the escalating payments are not clearly structured to compensate the lessor for expected inflationary cost increases based on published indexes or statistics, then X recognises annual rent expense on a straight-line basis: CU122,000 each year  (sum of the amounts payable under the lease divided by five years).

  <p id="idP21_6">21.6 The condition in <a class="clsPreview" href="#idP21_4a">paragraph 21.4(a)</a> (obligation at the reporting date as a result of a past event) means that the entity has no realistic alternative to settling the obligation.  This can happen when the entity has a legal obligation that can be enforced by law or when the entity has a <a class="clsPreview" href="#idconstructive-obligation">constructive obligation</a> because the past event (which may be an action of the entity) has created valid expectations in other parties that the entity will discharge the obligation.  Obligations that will arise from the entity’s future actions (ie the future conduct of its business) do not satisfy the condition in <a class="clsPreview" href="#idP21_4a">paragraph 21.4(a)</a>, no matter how likely they are to occur and even if they are contractual. To illustrate, because of commercial pressures or legal requirements, an entity may intend or need to carry out expenditure to operate in a particular way in the future (for example, by fitting smoke filters in a particular type of factory).  Because the entity can avoid the future expenditure by its future actions, for example by changing its method of operation or selling the factory, it has no present obligation for that future expenditure and no provision is recognised.

    <br>
    <br><span id="idP21_7a">(a) When the provision involves a large population of items, the estimate of the amount reflects the weighting of all possible outcomes by their associated probabilities. The provision will therefore be different depending on whether the probability of a loss of a given amount is, for example, 60 per cent or 90 per cent.  Where there is a continuous range of possible outcomes, and each point in that range is as likely as any other, the mid-point of the range is used.</span>

  <p id="idS21aP2">All of the entities in the examples in this Appendix have 31 December as their reporting date. In all cases, it is assumed that a reliable estimate can be made of any outflows expected.  In some examples the circumstances described may have resulted in impairment of the assets; this aspect is not dealt with in the examples.  References to ‘best estimate’ are to the present value amount, when the effect of the time value of money is material.

  <p id="idP21A_2">21A.2 An onerous contract is one in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. The unavoidable costs under a contract reflect the least net cost of exiting from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling it and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfil it.  For example, an entity may be contractually required under an operating lease to make payments to lease an asset for which it no longer has any use.
    <br>
    <br>Present obligation as a result of a past obligating event—The entity is contractually required to pay out resources for which it will not receive commensurate benefits.
    <br>

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idS21_8_4H3"></a></h3>
  <p id="idP21A_4">21A.4 A manufacturer gives warranties at the time of sale to purchasers of its product. Under the terms of the contract for sale, the manufacturer undertakes to make good, by repair or replacement, manufacturing defects that become apparent within three years from the date of sale. On the basis of experience, it is probable (ie more likely than not) that there will be some claims under the warranties.
    <br>
    <br>Present obligation as a result of a past obligating event—The obligating event is the sale of the product with a warranty, which gives rise to a legal obligation.
    <br>
    <br>An outflow of resources embodying economic benefits in settlement—Probable for the warranties as a whole.
    <br>
    <br>Conclusion—The entity recognises a provision for the best estimate of the costs of making good under the warranty products sold before the reporting date.
    <br>
    <br>Illustration of calculations:
    <br>
    <br>In 20X0, goods are sold for CU1,000,000.  Experience indicates that 90 per cent of products sold require no warranty repairs; 6 per cent of products sold require minor repairs costing 30 per cent of the sale price; and 4 per cent of products sold require major repairs or replacement costing 70 per cent of sale price.  Therefore estimated warranty costs are:

    <p class="clsIndent">The expenditures for warranty repairs and replacements for products sold in 20X0 are expected to be made 60 per cent in 20X1, 30 per cent in 20X2, and 10 per cent in 20X3, in each case at the end of the period. Because the estimated cash flows already reflect the probabilities of the cash outflows, and assuming there are no other risks or uncertainties that must be reflected, to determine the present value of those cash flows the entity uses a ‘risk-free’ discount rate based on government bonds with the same term as the expected cash outflows (6 per cent for one-year bonds and 7 per cent for two-year and three-year bonds).  Calculation of the present value, at the end of 20X0, of the estimated cash flows related to the warranties for products sold in 20X0 is as follows:

  <section id="idS22_2">
  <h2 id="idS22_2H2">Classification of an instrument as liability or equity
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idS22_2H2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idP22_3">22.3 Equity is the residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all its liabilities.  A liability is a present obligation of the entity arising from past events, the settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow from the entity of resources embodying economic benefits. Equity includes investments by the <a class="clsPreview" href="#idowners">owners</a> of the entity, plus additions to those investments earned through profitable operations and retained for use in the entity’s operations, minus reductions to owners’ investments as a result of unprofitable operations and distributions to owners.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idP22_3"></a></p>
  <p id="idP22_4">22.4 Some financial instruments that meet the definition of a <a class="clsPreview" href="#idliability">liability</a> are classified as equity because they represent the residual interest in the net assets of the entity:
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP22_4a">(a) A puttable instrument is a financial instrument that gives the holder the right to sell that instrument back to the issuer for cash or another financial asset or is automatically redeemed or repurchased by the issuer on the occurrence of an uncertain future event or the death or retirement of the instrument holder. A puttable instrument that has all of the following features is classified as an equity instrument:</span>
    <br>
    <br><span class="clsIndent">(i) It entitles the holder to a pro rata share of the entity’s net assets in the event of the entity’s liquidation.  The entity’s net assets are those assets that remain after deducting all other claims on its assets. </span>
    <br>
    <br><span class="clsIndent">(ii) The instrument is in the class of instruments that is subordinate to all other classes of instruments.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span class="clsIndent">(iii) All financial instruments in the class of instruments that is subordinate to all other classes of instruments have identical features.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span class="clsIndent">(iv) Apart from the contractual obligation for the issuer to repurchase or redeem the instrument for cash or another financial asset, the instrument does not include any contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset to another entity, or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the entity, and it is not a contract that will or may be settled in the entity’s own equity instruments.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span class="clsIndent">(v) The total expected cash flows attributable to the instrument over the life of the instrument are based substantially on the profit or loss, the change in the recognised net assets or the change in the fair value of the recognised and unrecognised net assets of the entity over the life of the instrument (excluding any effects of the instrument).</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP22_4b">(b) Instruments, or components of instruments, that are subordinate to all other classes of instruments are classified as equity if they impose on the entity an obligation to deliver to another party a pro rata share of the net assets of the entity only on liquidation.</span>
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idP22_4"></a></p>
  <p id="idP22_5">22.5 The following are examples of instruments that are classified as liabilities rather than equity:
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP22_5a">(a) An instrument is classified as a liability if the distribution of net assets on liquidation is subject to a maximum amount (a ceiling).  For example, if in liquidation the holders of the instrument receive a pro rata share of the net assets, but this amount is limited to a ceiling and the excess net assets are distributed to a charity organisation or the government, the instrument is not classified as equity.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP22_5b">(b) A puttable instrument is classified as equity if, when the put option is exercised, the holder receives a pro rata share of the net assets of the entity measured in accordance with this IFRS. However, if the holder is entitled to an amount measured on some other basis (such as local GAAP), the instrument is classified as a liability.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP22_5c">(c) An instrument is classified as a liability if it obliges the entity to make payments to the holder before liquidation, such as a mandatory dividend.</span>

  <p><em>The Appendix accompanies, but is not part of, <a href="#idS22">Section 22</a>.  It provides guidance for applying the requirements of <a class="clsPreview" href="#idP22_13">paragraphs 22.13</a>–22.15.</em>
    </p>
  <p>On 1 January 20X5 an entity issues 500 convertible bonds.  The bonds are issued at par with a face value of CU100 per bond and are for a five-year term, with no transaction costs. The total proceeds from the issue are CU50,000.  Interest is payable annually in arrears at an annual interest rate of 4 per cent.  Each bond is convertible, at the holder’s discretion, into 25 ordinary shares at any time up to maturity.  At the time the bonds are issued, the market interest rate for similar debt that does not have the conversion option is 6 per cent.
    </p>
  <p>When the instrument is issued, the liability component must be valued first, and the difference between the total proceeds on issue (which is the fair value of the instrument in its entirety) and the fair value of the liability component is assigned to the equity component.  The fair value of the liability component is calculated by determining its present value using the discount rate of 6 per cent.  The calculations and journal entries are illustrated below:
    <img src="HitpStnStd001.files/ifrsSme2009-img-pS22A-1.png" />
    </p>
  <p>The issuer of the bonds makes the following journal entry at issue on 1 January 20X5:
    <img src="HitpStnStd001.files/ifrsSme2009-img-pS22A-2.png" />
    </p>
  <p>The CU4,212 represents a discount on issue of the bonds, so the entry could also be shown ‘gross’:
    <img src="HitpStnStd001.files/ifrsSme2009-img-pS22A-3.png" />
    </p>
  <p>After issue, the issuer will amortise the bond discount according to the following table:
    <img src="HitpStnStd001.files/ifrsSme2009-img-pS22A-4.png" />
    </p>
  <p>At the end of 20X5, the issuer would make the following journal entry:

  <p><em>Present value of principal of CU50,000 at 6 per cent</em>
    </p>
  <p>CU50,000/(1.06)^5 = CU37,363
    </p>
  <p><em>Present value of the interest annuity of CU2,000 (= CU50,000 × 4 per cent) payable at the end of each of five years</em>
    </p>
  <p>The CU2,000 annual interest payments are an annuity—a cash flow stream with a limited number (n) of periodic payments (C), receivable at dates 1 to n. To calculate the present value of this annuity, future payments are discounted by the periodic rate of interest (i) using the following formula:
    <img src="HitpStnStd001.files/ifrsSme2009-img-pS22A-6.png" />
    </p>
  <p>Therefore, the present value of the CU2,000 interest payments is (CU2,000/.06) × [1 – [(1/1.06)^5] = CU8,425
    </p>
  <p>This is equivalent to the sum of the present values of the five individual CU2,000 payments, as follows:
    <img src="HitpStnStd001.files/ifrsSme2009-img-pS22A-7.png" />
    </p>
  <p>Yet another way to calculate this is to use a table of present value of an ordinary annuity in arrears, five periods, interest rate of 6 per cent per period.  (Such tables are easily found on the Internet.) The present value factor is 4.2124.  Multiplying this by the annuity payment of CU2,000 determines the present value of CU8,425.

  <p id="idP23_8">23.8 An entity usually applies the revenue recognition criteria in this section separately to each transaction. However, an entity applies the recognition criteria to the separately identifiable components of a single transaction when necessary to reflect the substance of the transaction. For example, an entity applies the recognition criteria to the separately identifiable components of a single transaction when the selling price of a product includes an identifiable amount for subsequent servicing.  Conversely, an entity applies the recognition criteria to two or more transactions together when they are linked in such a way that the commercial effect cannot be understood without reference to the series of transactions as a whole.  For example, an entity applies the recognition criteria to two or more transactions together when it sells goods and, at the same time, enters into a separate agreement to repurchase the goods at a later date, thus negating the substantive effect of the transaction.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idP23_10"></a></p>
  <p id="idP23_11">23.11 The assessment of when an entity has transferred the significant risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer requires an examination of the circumstances of the transaction. In most cases, the transfer of the risks and rewards of ownership coincides with the transfer of the legal title or the passing of possession to the buyer.  This is the case for most retail sales. In other cases, the transfer of risks and rewards of ownership occurs at a time different from the transfer of legal title or the passing of possession.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idP23_11"></a></p>
  <p id="idP23_12">23.12 An entity does not recognise revenue if it retains significant risks of ownership. Examples of situations in which the entity may retain the significant risks and rewards of ownership are:
    <br>

    <br>
    <br><span id="idP23_12b">(b) when the receipt of the revenue from a particular sale is contingent on the buyer selling the goods.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP23_12c">(c) when the goods are shipped subject to installation and the installation is a significant part of the contract that has not yet been completed.</span>

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idP23_12"></a></p>
  <p id="idP23_13">23.13 If an entity retains only an insignificant risk of ownership, the transaction is a sale and the entity recognises the revenue. For example, a seller recognises revenue when it retains the legal title to the goods solely to protect the collectibility of the amount due.  Similarly an entity recognises revenue when it offers a refund if the customer finds the goods faulty or is not satisfied for other reasons, and the entity can estimate the returns reliably.  In such cases, the entity recognises a provision for returns in accordance with <a href="#idS21">Section 21</a> <em>Provisions and Contingencies</em>.

An example is a licensing agreement for the use of software when the licensor has no obligations after delivery.  Another example is the granting of rights to exhibit a motion picture film in markets in which the licensor has no control over the distributor and expects to receive no further revenues from the box office receipts.

  <p id="idP26_7">26.7 For equity-settled share-based payment transactions, an entity shall measure the goods or services received, and the corresponding increase in equity, at the fair value of the goods or services received, unless that fair value cannot be estimated reliably.  If the entity cannot estimate reliably the fair value of the goods or services received, the entity shall measure their value, and the corresponding increase in equity, by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.  To apply this requirement to transactions with employees and others providing similar services, the entity shall measure the fair value of the services received by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted, because typically it is not possible to estimate reliably the fair value of the services received.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idP26_7"></a></p>

  <p id="idP26_9">26.9 A grant of equity instruments might be conditional on employees satisfying specified vesting conditions related to service or performance.  For example, a grant of shares or share options to an employee is typically conditional on the employee remaining in the entity’s employ for a specified period of time.  There might be performance conditions that must be satisfied, such as the entity achieving a specified growth in profit (a non-market vesting condition) or a specified increase in the entity’s share price (a market vesting condition).  All vesting conditions related to solely employee service or to a non-market performance condition shall be taken into account when estimating the number of equity instruments expected to vest. Subsequently, the entity shall revise that estimate, if necessary, if new information indicates that the number of equity instruments expected to vest differs from previous estimates. On vesting date, the entity shall revise the estimate to equal the number of equity instruments that ultimately vested. All market vesting conditions and non-vesting conditions shall be taken into account when estimating the fair value of the shares or share options at the measurement date, with no subsequent adjustment irrespective of the outcome.

    <br><span id="idP27_9d">(d) The carrying amount of the net assets of the entity is more than the estimated fair value of the entity as a whole (such an estimate may have been made, for example, in relation to the potential sale of part or all of the entity).</span>

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idS27_4H2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idP27_24">27.24 Goodwill, by itself, cannot be sold.  Nor does it generate cash flows to an entity that are independent of the cash flows of other assets.  As a consequence, the fair value of goodwill cannot be measured directly.  Therefore, the fair value of goodwill must be derived from measurement of the fair value of the cash-generating unit(s) of which the goodwill is a part.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idP27_24"></a></p>
  <p id="idP27_25">27.25 For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination shall, from the acquisition date, be allocated to each of the acquirer’s cash-generating units that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idP27_25"></a></p>
  <p id="idP27_26">27.26 Part of the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is attributable to the non-controlling interest in goodwill. For the purpose of impairment testing a non-wholly-owned cash-generating unit with goodwill, the carrying amount of that unit is notionally adjusted, before being compared with its recoverable amount, by grossing up the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the unit to include the goodwill attributable to the non-controlling interest.  This notionally adjusted carrying amount is then compared with the recoverable amount of the unit to determine whether the cash-generating unit is impaired.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idP27_26"></a></p>
  <p id="idP27_27">27.27 If goodwill cannot be allocated to individual cash-generating units (or groups of cash-generating units) on a non-arbitrary basis, then for the purposes of testing goodwill the entity shall test the impairment of goodwill by determining the recoverable amount of either (a) or (b):
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP27_27a">(a) the acquired entity in its entirety, if the goodwill relates to an acquired entity that has not been integrated. Integrated means the acquired business has been restructured or dissolved into the reporting entity or other subsidiaries.</span>

    <br><span id="idP27_27b">(b) the entire group of entities, excluding any entities that have not been integrated, if the goodwill relates to an entity that has been integrated.</span>
    <br>
    <br>In applying this paragraph, an entity will need to separate goodwill into goodwill relating to entities that have been integrated and goodwill relating to entities that have not been integrated.  Also the entity shall follow the requirements for cash-generating units in this section when calculating the recoverable amount of, and allocating impairment losses and reversals to assets belonging to, the acquired entity or group of entities.

If defined benefits are based on future salaries, the projected unit credit method requires an entity to measure its defined benefit obligations on a basis that reflects estimated future salary increases. Additionally, the projected unit credit method requires an entity to make various actuarial assumptions in measuring the defined benefit obligation, including discount rates, the expected rates of return on plan assets, expected rates of salary increases, employee turnover, mortality, and (for defined benefit medical plans) medical cost trend rates.

  <p id="idP28_19">28.19 If an entity is not able, without undue cost or effort, to use the projected unit credit method to measure its obligation and cost under defined benefit plans, the entity is permitted to make the following simplifications in measuring its defined benefit obligation with respect to current employees:

Employee service before the vesting date gives rise to a constructive obligation because, at each successive reporting date, the amount of future service that an employee will have to render before becoming entitled to the benefit is reduced. In measuring its defined benefit obligation, an entity considers the probability that some employees may not satisfy vesting requirements.  Similarly, although some post-employment benefits (such as post-employment medical benefits) become payable only if a specified event occurs when an employee is no longer employed (such as an illness), an obligation is created when the employee renders service that will provide entitlement to the benefit if the specified event occurs. The probability that the specified event will occur affects the measurement of the obligation, but does not determine whether the obligation exists.

  <p id="idP29_11">29.11 An entity shall determine the tax basis of an asset, liability or other item in accordance with enacted or substantively enacted law. If the entity files a consolidated tax return, the tax basis is determined by the tax law governing the consolidated tax return.  If the entity files separate tax returns for different operations, the tax basis is determined by the tax laws governing each tax return.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idP29_11"></a></p>
  <p id="idP29_12">29.12 The tax basis determines the amounts that will be included in taxable profit on recovery or settlement of the carrying amount of an asset or liability.  Specifically:
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP29_12a">(a) the tax basis of an asset equals the amount that would have been deductible in arriving at taxable profit if the carrying amount of the asset had been recovered through sale at the end of the reporting period.  If the recovery of the asset through sale does not increase taxable profit, the tax basis shall be deemed to be equal to the carrying amount.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP29_12b">(b) the tax basis of a liability equals its carrying amount less any amounts deductible in determining taxable profit (or plus any amounts included in taxable profit) that would have arisen if the liability had been settled for its carrying amount at the end of the reporting period.  In the case of deferred revenue, the tax base of the resulting liability is its carrying amount, less any amount of revenue that will not be taxable in future periods.</span>
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idP29_12"></a></p>
  <p id="idP29_13">29.13 Some items have a tax basis but are not recognised as assets and liabilities. For example, research costs are recognised as an expense when they are incurred but may not be permitted as a deduction in determining taxable profit until a future period.  Thus, the carrying amount of the research costs is nil and the tax basis is the amount that will be deducted in future periods. An equity instrument issued by the entity may also give rise to deductions in a future period.  There is no asset or liability in the statement of financial position, but the tax basis is the amount of the future deductions.

  <p id="idP32_5">32.5 The following are examples of adjusting events after the end of the reporting period that require an entity to adjust the amounts recognised in its financial statements, or to recognise items that were not previously recognised:
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP32_5a">(a) the settlement after the end of the reporting period of a court case that confirms that the entity had a present obligation at the end of the reporting period. The entity adjusts any previously recognised <a class="clsPreview" href="#idprovision">provision</a> related to this court case in accordance with <a href="#idS21">Section 21</a> <em>Provisions and Contingencies</em> or recognises a new provision.  The entity does not merely disclose a contingent liability. Rather, the settlement provides additional evidence to be considered in determining the provision that should be recognised at the end of the reporting period in accordance with Section 21.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP32_5b">(b) the receipt of information after the end of the reporting period indicating that an asset was impaired at the end of the reporting period, or that the amount of a previously recognised impairment loss for that asset needs to be adjusted.  For example:</span>
    <br>
    <br><span class="clsIndent">(i) the bankruptcy of a customer that occurs after the end of the reporting period usually confirms that a loss existed at the end of the reporting period on a trade receivable and that the entity needs to adjust the <a class="clsPreview" href="#idcarrying-amount">carrying amount</a> of the trade receivable; and</span>
    <br>
    <br><span class="clsIndent">(ii) the sale of inventories after the end of the reporting period may give evidence about their selling price at the end of the reporting period for the purpose of assessing impairment at that date.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP32_5c">(c) the determination after the end of the reporting period of the cost of assets purchased, or the proceeds from assets sold, before the end of the reporting period.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP32_5d">(d) the determination after the end of the reporting period of the amount of profit-sharing or bonus payments, if the entity had a legal or <a class="clsPreview" href="#idconstructive-obligation">constructive obligation</a> at the end of the reporting period to make such payments as a result of events before that date (see <a href="#idS28">Section 28</a> <em>Employee Benefits</em>).</span>

The decline in market value does not normally relate to the condition of the investments at the end of the reporting period, but reflects circumstances that have arisen subsequently.  Therefore, an entity does not adjust the amounts recognised in its financial statements for the investments.  Similarly, the entity does not update the amounts disclosed for the investments as at the end of the reporting period, although it may need to give additional disclosure in accordance with <a class="clsPreview" href="#idP32_10">paragraph 32.10</a>.</span>

  <p id="idP34_4">34.4 An entity shall measure a biological asset on initial recognition and at each <a class="clsPreview" href="#idreporting-date">reporting date</a> at its fair value less costs to sell.  Changes in fair value less costs to sell shall be recognised in profit or loss.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idP34_4"></a></p>
  <p id="idP34_5">34.5 Agricultural produce harvested from an entity’s biological assets shall be measured at its fair value less costs to sell at the point of harvest.

    <a class="clsHide" href="#idP34_5"></a></p>
  <p id="idP34_6">34.6 In determining fair value, an entity shall consider the following:
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP34_6a">(a) If an active market exists for a biological asset or agricultural produce in its present location and condition, the quoted price in that market is the appropriate basis for determining the fair value of that asset.  If an entity has access to different active markets, the entity shall use the price existing in the market that it expects to use.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP34_6b">(b) If an active market does not exist, an entity uses one or more of the following, when available, in determining fair value:</span>
    <br>
    <br><span class="clsIndent">(i) the most recent market transaction price, provided that there has not been a significant change in economic circumstances between the date of that transaction and the end of the reporting period;</span>
    <br>
    <br><span class="clsIndent">(ii) market prices for similar assets with adjustment to reflect differences; and</span>
    <br>
    <br><span class="clsIndent">(iii) sector benchmarks such as the value of an orchard expressed per export tray, bushel, or hectare, and the value of cattle expressed per kilogram of meat.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP34_6c">(c) In some cases, the information sources listed in (a) or (b) may suggest different conclusions as to the fair value of a biological asset or agricultural produce.  An entity considers the reasons for those differences, to arrive at the most reliable estimate of fair value within a relatively narrow range of reasonable estimates.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP34_6d">(d) In some circumstances, fair value may be readily determinable without undue cost or effort even though market determined prices or values are not available for a biological asset in its present condition.  An entity shall consider whether the present value of expected net cash flows from the asset discounted at a current market determined rate results in a reliable measure of fair value.</span>

  <h2 id="idS34_4H2">Service concession arrangements
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idS34_4H2"></a></h2>
  <p id="idP34_12">34.12 A service concession arrangement is an arrangement whereby a government or other public sector body (the grantor) contracts with a private operator to develop (or upgrade), operate and maintain the grantor’s infrastructure assets such as roads, bridges, tunnels, airports, energy distribution networks, prisons or hospitals.  In those arrangements, the grantor controls or regulates what services the operator must provide using the assets, to whom, and at what price, and also controls any significant residual interest in the assets at the end of the term of the arrangement.
    <a class="clsHide" href="#idP34_12"></a></p>
  <p id="idP34_13">34.13 There are two principal categories of service concession arrangements:
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP34_13a">(a) In one, the operator receives a financial asset—an unconditional contractual right to receive a specified or determinable amount of cash or another financial asset from the government in return for constructing or upgrading a public sector asset, and then operating and maintaining the asset for a specified period of time.  This category includes guarantees by the government to pay for any shortfall between amounts received from users of the public service and specified or determinable amounts.</span>
    <br>
    <br><span id="idP34_13b">(b) In the other, the operator receives an intangible asset—a right to charge for use of a public sector asset that it constructs or upgrades and then operates and maintains for a specified period of time.  A right to charge users is not an unconditional right to receive cash because the amounts are contingent on the extent to which the public uses the service.</span>
    <br>
    <br>Sometimes, a single contract may contain both types: to the extent that the government has given an unconditional guarantee of payment for the construction of the public sector asset, the operator has a financial asset; to the extent that the operator has to rely on the public using the service in order to obtain payment, the operator has an intangible asset.

    <br>">international-organization overview:
    <br>International organizations (IOs) are associations of sovereign states, intergovernmental organizations, or other entities with international scope, which come together voluntarily to achieve common objectives. They play a crucial role in addressing global challenges and promoting international cooperation.
    <br>
    <br>**Types of International Organizations**
    <br>* **Intergovernmental organizations (IGOs)** are formal entities established by treaties or agreements between governments. They have their own legal personalities and are distinct from their member states. Examples include the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, and the International Monetary Fund.
    <br>* **Non-governmental organizations (NGOs)** are private organizations that are not affiliated with any government. They play an important role in advocacy, humanitarian assistance, and development work. Examples include Amnesty International, Oxfam, and Greenpeace.
    <br>* **International organizations of states (IOS)** are a hybrid type of organization that combines elements of both IGOs and NGOs. They are often established by governments but have some degree of autonomy. Examples include the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
    <br>**Purposes of International Organizations**
    <br>
    <br>IOs serve a wide range of purposes, including:
    <br>* **Maintaining international peace and security:** IOs such as the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) work to prevent and resolve conflicts and promote cooperation on security issues.
    <br>* **Promoting human rights and democracy:** IOs such as the United Nations Human Rights Council and the Council of Europe promote and protect human rights and democratic values.
    <br>* **Addressing global economic and social challenges:** IOs such as the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Health Organization work to address global economic and social challenges, such as poverty, hunger, disease, and climate change.
    <br>* **Promoting sustainable development:** IOs such as the United Nations Environment Programme and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations work to promote sustainable development and environmental protection.
    <br>* **Facilitating international cooperation:** IOs provide forums for governments to cooperate on a wide range of issues, from trade and finance to environmental protection and health.
    <br>**Impact of International Organizations**
    <br>
    <br>IOs have had a significant impact on the world, contributing to:
    <br>* **Increased international cooperation:** IOs have facilitated cooperation among governments on a wide range of issues, helping to address global challenges and promote shared interests.
    <br>* **Advancement of human rights:** IOs have played a key role in promoting and protecting human rights around the world.
    <br>* **Economic development:** IOs have helped to promote economic development and trade liberalization, contributing to global economic growth.
    <br>* **Peace and security:** IOs have worked to prevent and resolve conflicts, and to promote peace and security around the world.
    <br>
    <br>Despite their many successes, IOs also face challenges, including:
    <br>* **Ensuring accountability:** IOs must be accountable to their member states and to the public for their actions.
    <br>* **Adapting to a changing world:** IOs must adapt to the rapidly changing international landscape and address new and emerging challenges.
    <br>* **Coordinating with other actors:** IOs must coordinate effectively with other international organizations, national governments, and non-governmental organizations to achieve their goals.
    <br>
    <br>International organizations continue to play an important role in addressing global challenges and promoting international cooperation. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the need for effective IOs will only grow."

    <br>">international organization international-law:
    <br>**International organizations** and **international law** are closely intertwined concepts. International organizations are legal entities created by states to address shared challenges and pursue common goals. They play a crucial role in developing and implementing international law, which is the body of rules and principles that govern relations between states.
    <br>
    <br>**International organizations** are established through treaties, which are formal agreements between states. Treaties define the purpose, structure, and powers of an international organization. Once an organization is established, it becomes an actor in its own right, with the capacity to enter into contracts, sue and be sued, and own property.
    <br>
    <br>International organizations play a variety of roles in the development and implementation of international law. They can:
    <br>* **Codify international law:** International organizations can codify existing international law by drafting and adopting treaties that consolidate and clarify the existing rules and principles. For example, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) codifies the customary rules of international law relating to the oceans.
    <br>* **Develop new norms of international law:** International organizations can also develop new norms of international law through their resolutions, declarations, and other instruments. These instruments may not be legally binding, but they can nevertheless influence state behavior and set precedents for future legal developments. For example, the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights has been instrumental in the development of international human rights law.
    <br>* **Implement international law:** International organizations can also play a role in implementing international law by monitoring state compliance, providing technical assistance, and resolving disputes. For example, the World Trade Organization (WTO) has a dispute settlement mechanism that helps to resolve trade disputes between states.
    <br>
    <br>In addition to these direct roles, international organizations also contribute to the development and implementation of international law by:
    <br>* **Providing a forum for states to negotiate and adopt treaties:** International organizations provide a neutral forum for states to negotiate and adopt treaties, which are the primary source of international law.
    <br>* **Exchanging information and expertise:** International organizations facilitate the exchange of information and expertise among states, which can help to promote a common understanding of international law.
    <br>* **Raising awareness of international law:** International organizations raise awareness of international law through their publications, conferences, and other activities.
    <br>
    <br>The relationship between international organizations and international law is mutually reinforcing. International law provides the framework for the creation and operation of international organizations, while international organizations play a crucial role in developing and implementing international law."

    <br>">quantity of international-organizations:
    <br>The exact number of international organizations is difficult to determine as there is no single, definitive source for this information. However, the Union of International Associations (UIA) maintains a database of over 68,000 international organizations, both active and inactive. This database includes organizations that meet the UIA's criteria, which are:
    <br>* The organization must have an international scope, meaning that it operates in two or more countries.
    <br>* The organization must have a permanent structure, meaning that it has a staff, an office, and a budget.
    <br>* The organization must have a stated purpose that is not primarily commercial.
    <br>
    <br>Based on the UIA's database, it is estimated that there are over 300 intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) and over 65,000 international non-governmental organizations (INGOs). IGOs are organizations that are created by treaties between governments, such as the United Nations and the World Health Organization. INGOs are organizations that are not created by treaties, but are instead formed by private individuals or groups, such as Amnesty International and the Red Cross.
    <br>
    <br>The number of international organizations has been growing steadily in recent years. This growth is due to a number of factors, including:
    <br>* The increasing globalization of the world economy
    <br>* The increasing complexity of global problems, such as climate change and terrorism
    <br>* The growing recognition of the need for international cooperation to address these problems
    <br>
    <br>International organizations play an important role in global governance. They provide a forum for countries to cooperate on issues of common concern, they develop and implement international norms and standards, and they provide technical assistance and other forms of support to countries."

    <br>"An international organisation in Strasbourg which comprises 47 countries of Europe. It was set up to promote democracy and protect human rights and the rule of law in Europe."
    <br>[{2020-11-28} https://www.coe.int/en/web/about-us/do-not-get-confused]
    <br>
    <br>"The Council of Europe is a leading human rights organization of Europe, but it encompasses much broader areas than just the European Union. Founded on May 5, 1949, by the Treaty of London, it is an international organization dedicated to promoting democracy, the rule of law, human rights, and cultural cooperation among its member states. As of my last update, the Council of Europe has 46 member countries, including all European Union states as well as other non-EU countries across the continent.
    <br>The Council of Europe operates with several key institutions and agreements under its umbrella:
    <br>1. **European Court of Human Rights (ECHR)**: Perhaps the most well-known institution of the Council of Europe. It enforces the European Convention on Human Rights. Individuals who believe their rights under the Convention have been violated can bring their case to the ECHR after exhausting all domestic legal remedies.
    <br>2. **Parliamentary Assembly**: Composed of members of national parliaments from the member states, this body deliberates on policy issues, advises on improvements, and monitors elections among other activities. It is instrumental in the drafting and recommendation of conventions and agreements for member states to adopt.
    <br>3. **Committee of Ministers**: The Council's decision-making body, consisting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs or their permanent diplomatic representatives from each member state. It is responsible for the overall direction and policy setting of the Council of Europe.
    <br>4. **Congress of Local and Regional Authorities**: A pan-European political assembly, the congress is responsible for promoting local and regional democracy, improving local and regional governance, and strengthening authorities' self-government.
    <br>5. **European Convention on Human Rights**: A landmark treaty that has been a cornerstone in the development of international law and human rights standards in Europe. Signing and ratifying this convention is a prerequisite for joining the Council of Europe.
    <br>6. **Venice Commission**: Officially known as the European Commission for Democracy through Law, this advisory body of the Council provides legal advice to its member states and helps to promote democratic institutions and the rule of law.
    <br>7. **Social Charter**: A treaty guaranteeing social and economic human rights. It complements the European Convention on Human Rights in the social and economic fields.
    <br>The Council of Europe should not be confused with the European Council or the Council of the European Union, which are EU bodies. Unlike the European Union, the Council of Europe cannot make binding laws but can enforce select international agreements reached by European states on various issues, including the prevention of torture, human trafficking, and the protection of minorities. The headquarters of the Council of Europe is in Strasbourg, France."

    <br>"The European Centre for Modern Languages (ECML) – a centre to promote quality language education in Europe
    <br>Contemporary European societies are characterised and enriched by linguistic and cultural diversity, by migration and mobility. However, we only truly value and treasure these characteristics by recognising and responding to the associated challenges.
    <br>Language education is key: the provision of lifelong, quality language education supports not only educational and professional success, but personal development and a sense of self-worth, which in turn contribute to a democratic, socially cohesive and peaceful Europe.
    <br>
    <br>The Council of Europe has played a central role in bringing about positive change in the field of language education across Europe and beyond, broadening the aims from an exclusive focus on modern foreign languages to embrace areas such as plurilingual, cultural and cognitive competences. By capitalising on learners’ individual linguistic repertoires, it places democratic citizenship and human rights at the core of learning and teaching, promoting linguistic and cultural diversity in the pursuit of quality education for all.
    <br>
    <br>The ECML, an Enlarged Partial Agreement of the Council of Europe, situated at the interface between policy, research, teacher education and practice, is in a unique position to act as a catalyst for reform and to help member states implement quality language education.
    <br>
    <br>Established in Graz, Austria in 1994, the ECML’s mission is to encourage excellence and innovation in language teaching and support its member states in the implementation of effective language education policies. It does so by working with decision-makers in member states and bringing together language experts to develop innovative, research-informed solutions to challenges in language education.
    <br>
    <br>The ECML recognises the importance of pedagogical approaches which are differentiated according to learner needs and to specific language contexts (home/first, second, foreign, regional, of migration, in subjects etc.). It values all those working in the field from early years through to adult education and contributes to their professionalisation by providing access to innovative resources and to transformative development opportunities. Through its networks at national and international level and through dialogue and exchange with relevant stakeholders, the ECML is ideally equipped to act as a pioneering institution in the teaching and learning of languages.
    <br>
    <br>The ECML initiates and coordinates 4-year programmes which provide the framework for multilateral development projects, bilateral in-country capacity-building (ECML Training and consultancy) as well as a range of activities for a wider public."

    <br>"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an international financial institution, headquartered in Washington, D.C., consisting of 190 countries working to foster global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable economic growth, and reduce poverty around the world while periodically depending on the World Bank for its resources.[1] Formed in July 1944,[7] at the Bretton Woods Conference primarily by the ideas of Harry Dexter White and John Maynard Keynes,[8] it came into formal existence in 1945 with 29 member countries and the goal of reconstructing the international monetary system. It now plays a central role in the management of balance of payments difficulties and international financial crises.[9] Countries contribute funds to a pool through a quota system from which countries experiencing balance of payments problems can borrow money. As of 2016, the fund had XDR 477 billion (about US$667 billion).[10]
    <br>Through the fund and other activities such as the gathering of statistics and analysis, surveillance of its members' economies, and the demand for particular policies,[11] the IMF works to improve the economies of its member countries.[12] The organization's objectives stated in the Articles of Agreement are:[13] to promote international monetary co-operation, international trade, high employment, exchange-rate stability, sustainable economic growth, and making resources available to member countries in financial difficulty.[14] IMF funds come from two major sources: quotas and loans. Quotas, which are pooled funds of member nations, generate most IMF funds. The size of a member's quota depends on its economic and financial importance in the world. Nations with greater economic significance have larger quotas. The quotas are increased periodically as a means of boosting the IMF's resources in the form of special drawing rights.[15]
    <br>The current Managing Director (MD) and Chairwoman of the IMF is Bulgarian economist Kristalina Georgieva, who has held the post since October 1, 2019.[16] Gita Gopinath was appointed as Chief Economist of IMF from 1 October 2018. Prior to her appointment at the IMF, Gopinath served as the economic adviser to the Chief Minister of Kerala, India.[17]"

    <br>The WHO was established by constitution on 7 April 1948,[3] which is commemorated as World Health Day.[4] The first meeting of the World Health Assembly (WHA), the agency's governing body, took place on 24 July 1948. The WHO incorporated the assets, personnel, and duties of the League of Nations' Health Organisation and the Office International d'Hygiène Publique, including the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).[5] Its work began in earnest in 1951 following a significant infusion of financial and technical resources.[6]
    <br>The WHO's broad mandate includes advocating for universal healthcare, monitoring public health risks, coordinating responses to health emergencies, and promoting human health and well being.[7] It provides technical assistance to countries, sets international health standards and guidelines, and collects data on global health issues through the World Health Survey. Its flagship publication, the World Health Report, provides expert assessments of global health topics and health statistics on all nations.[8] The WHO also serves as a forum for summits and discussions on health issues.[1]"

    <br>"The World Trade Organization (WTO) is an intergovernmental organization that regulates and facilitates international trade between nations. It officially commenced operations on 1 January 1995, pursuant to the 1994 Marrakesh Agreement, replacing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which was established in 1948. The WTO is the world's largest international economic organization, with 164 member states representing over 96% of global trade and global GDP.[6][7][8]
    <br>The WTO facilitates trade in goods, services and intellectual property among participating countries by providing a framework for negotiating trade agreements, which usually aim to reduce or eliminate tariffs, quotas, and other restrictions; these agreements are signed by representatives of member governments[9]:fol.9–10 and ratified by their legislatures.[10] The WTO also administers independent dispute resolution for enforcing participants' adherence to trade agreements and resolving trade-related disputes.[11] The organization prohibits discrimination between trading partners, but provides exceptions for environmental protection, national security, and other important goals.[11]
    <br>The WTO is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.[12] Its top decision making body is the Ministerial Conference, which is composed of all member states and usually convenes biannually; consensus is emphasized in all decisions.[13] Day-to-day functions are handled by the General Council, made up of representatives from all members.[14] A Secretariat of over 600 personnel, led by the Director-General and four deputies, provides administrative, professional, and technical services.[15] The WTO's annual budget is roughly 220 million USD, which is contributed by members based on their proportion of international trade.[16]
    <br>Studies show the WTO has boosted trade and reduced trade barriers.[17][18][11][19] It has also influenced trade agreement generally; a 2017 analysis found that the vast majority of preferential trade agreements (PTAs) up to that point explicitly reference the WTO, with substantial portions of text copied from WTO agreements.[20] Goal 10 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals also referenced WTO agreements as instruments of reducing inequality.[21] However, critics contend that the benefits of WTO-facilitated free trade are not shared equally, citing the outcomes of negotiations and data showing a continually widening gap between rich and poor nations.[22][23]"

    <br>The WEF hosts an annual meeting at the end of January in Davos, a mountain resort in Graubünden, in the eastern Alps region of Switzerland. The meeting brings together some 3,000 business leaders, international political leaders, economists, celebrities and journalists for up to five days to discuss global issues, across 500 sessions.
    <br>The organization also convenes some six to eight regional meetings each year in locations across Africa, East Asia, Latin America, and India and holds two further annual meetings in China and the United Arab Emirates. Beside meetings, the organization provides a platform for leaders from all stakeholder groups from around the world – business, government and civil society – to collaborate on multiple projects and initiatives.[2] It also produces a series of reports and engages its members in sector-specific initiatives.[3]
    <br>The World Economic Forum and its annual meeting in Davos are criticised regarding the public cost of security, the formation of a wealthy global elite without attachment to the broader societies, undemocratic decision processes, gender issues and a lack of financial transparency."

    <br>"The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement is an international humanitarian movement with approximately 97 million volunteers, members and staff worldwide, which was founded to protect human life and health, to ensure respect for all human beings, and to prevent and alleviate human suffering. Within three distinct organizations that are legally independent from each other, but are united within the movement through common basic principles, objectives, symbols, statutes and governing organisations, there are the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), that is a private humanitarian institution founded in 1863 in Geneva, Switzerland, in particular by Henry Dunant and Gustave Moynier. Its 25-member committee has a unique authority under international humanitarian law to protect the life and dignity of the victims of international and internal armed conflicts. The ICRC was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on three occasions (in 1917, 1944 and 1963).
    <br>The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) was founded in 1919 and today it coordinates between the 190 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies within the Movement, internationally in close cooperation with the National Societies, relief assistance missions responding to large-scale emergencies. The International Federation Secretariat is based in Geneva, Switzerland. In 1963, the Federation (then known as the League of Red Cross Societies) was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize jointly with the ICRC.
    <br>The National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies exist in nearly every country in the world. Currently 190 National Societies are recognized by the ICRC and admitted as full members of the Federation. Each entity works in its home country according to the principles of international humanitarian law and the statutes of the international Movement. Depending on their specific circumstances and capacities, National Societies can take on additional humanitarian tasks that are not directly defined by international humanitarian law or the mandates of the international Movement. They are tightly linked to the respective national health care system by providing emergency medical services in every country."

  <p id="idOgznIntl010dsn">description::
    <br>"The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC, /ˈoʊpɛk/ OH-pek) is an intergovernmental organization of 13 countries. Founded on 14 September 1960 in Baghdad by the first five members (Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela), it has since 1965 been headquartered in Vienna, Austria, although Austria is not an OPEC member state. As of September 2018, the 13 member countries accounted for an estimated 44 percent of global oil production and 81.5 percent of the world's "proven" oil reserves, giving OPEC a major influence on global oil prices that were previously determined by the so-called "Seven Sisters" grouping of multinational oil companies. A larger group called OPEC+ was formed in late 2016, to have more control on global crude oil market.[5] The demand for OPEC oil has fallen to a 30-year low in the second quarter of 2020.[6]
    <br>The stated mission of the organization is to "coordinate and unify the petroleum policies of its member countries and ensure the stabilization of oil markets, in order to secure an efficient, economic and regular supply of petroleum to consumers, a steady income to producers, and a fair return on capital for those investing in the petroleum industry."[7] The organization is also a significant provider of information about the international oil market. The current OPEC members are the following: Algeria, Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, the Republic of the Congo, Saudi Arabia (the De facto leader), the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. Former OPEC members are Ecuador, Indonesia and Qatar.[8]
    <br>The formation of OPEC marked a turning point toward national sovereignty over natural resources, and OPEC decisions have come to play a prominent role in the global oil market and international relations. The effect can be particularly strong when wars or civil disorders lead to extended interruptions in supply. In the 1970s, restrictions in oil production led to a dramatic rise in oil prices and in the revenue and wealth of OPEC, with long-lasting and far-reaching consequences for the global economy. In the 1980s, OPEC began setting production targets for its member nations; generally, when the targets are reduced, oil prices increase. This has occurred most recently from the organization's 2008, and 2016 decisions to trim oversupply.
    <br>Economists often cite OPEC as a textbook example of a cartel that cooperates to reduce market competition, but one whose consultations are protected by the doctrine of state immunity under international law. In December 2014, "OPEC and the oil men" ranked as #3 on Lloyd's list of "the top 100 most influential people in the shipping industry".[9] However, the influence of OPEC on international trade is periodically challenged by the expansion of non-OPEC energy sources, and by the recurring temptation for individual OPEC countries to exceed production targets and pursue conflicting self-interests.
    <br>In October 2019, Saudi Arabia invited Brazil to join OPEC.[10] The president of Petrobras, Roberto Castello Branco, in an interview in New York, said that being a member of OPEC is not an option currently considered by the Brazilian federal government.[11]"

NATO's Headquarters are located in Evere, Brussels, Belgium, while the headquarters of Allied Command Operations is near Mons, Belgium.
    <br>Since its founding, the admission of new member states has increased the alliance from the original 12 countries to 30.

NATO currently recognizes Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, and Ukraine as aspiring members.[5] An additional 20 countries participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, with 15 other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue programs. The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70% of the global total.[6] Members agreed that their aim is to reach or maintain the target defense spending of at least 2% of GDP by 2024.[7][8]"

    <br>"The International Criminal Police Organization (official abbreviation ICPO; French: Organisation internationale de police criminelle), commonly known as INTERPOL (UK: /ˈɪnt.ər.pɒl/ INT-ər-pol, US: /-poʊl/ -⁠pohl),[4] is an international organization that facilitates worldwide police cooperation and crime control. Headquartered in Lyon, it has seven regional bureaux worldwide and a National Central Bureau in all 194 member states, making it the world's largest police organization.[5]
    <br>INTERPOL originated with the first International Criminal Police Congress in 1914, which brought officials from 24 countries to discuss cooperation on law enforcement matters. It was founded in 1923 as the International Criminal Police Commission (ICPC), adopting many of its current duties throughout the 1930s. After coming under Nazi control in 1938, the agency was effectively moribund until after the Second World War. In 1956, the ICPC adopted a new constitution and the name INTERPOL, derived from its telegraphic address used since 1946.[6]"

    <br>"The International Labour Organization (ILO) is a United Nations agency whose mandate is to advance social and economic justice through setting international labour standards.[1] Founded in October 1919 under the League of Nations, it is the first and oldest specialised agency of the UN. The ILO has 187 member states: 186 out of 193 UN member states plus the Cook Islands. It is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, with around 40 field offices around the world, and employs some 2,700 staff from over 150 nations, of whom 900 work in technical cooperation programmes and projects.
    <br>The ILO's international labour standards are broadly aimed at ensuring accessible, productive, and sustainable work worldwide in conditions of freedom, equity, security and dignity.[2][3] They are set forth in 189 conventions and treaties, of which eight are classified as fundamental according to the 1998 Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work; together they protect freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, the elimination of forced or compulsory labour, the abolition of child labour, and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. The ILO is subsequently a major contributor to international labour law."

    <br>">BRICS members:
    <br>BRICS is an acronym for an intergovernmental association of five emerging economies: Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. The organization was founded in 2006 and has since expanded to include Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. BRICS is a forum for promoting international cooperation in areas such as trade, investment, finance, and technology.
    <br>Here is a table of the current BRICS members:
    <br>| Member | Initial Member | Year of Joining |
    <br>| Brazil | Yes | 2006 |
    <br>| Russia | Yes | 2006 |
    <br>| India | Yes | 2006 |
    <br>| China | Yes | 2006 |
    <br>| South Africa | Yes | 2010 |
    <br>| Egypt | No | 2024 |
    <br>| Ethiopia | No | 2024 |
    <br>| Iran | No | 2024 |
    <br>| Saudi Arabia | No | 2024 |
    <br>| United Arab Emirates | No | 2024 |
    <br>The expansion of BRICS to include new members has been met with mixed reactions. Some experts believe that the expansion will dilute the organization's focus and make it more difficult to achieve its goals. Others believe that the expansion will strengthen BRICS and make it a more influential player on the global stage. The ultimate impact of the expansion will depend on how effectively the new members integrate into the organization and how they contribute to its work."

    <br>""SCO framework" most commonly refers to the organizational and legal structure of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).
    <br>The SCO is a Eurasian political, economic, and international security organization. It was founded in 2001 by China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Over time, it has expanded to include other members, such as India, Iran, and Pakistan.
    <br>The SCO framework is a set of principles, agreements, and institutional bodies that govern the cooperation among its member states. Here are the key components of this framework:
    <br>1. Guiding Principles and Concepts
    <br>The "Shanghai Spirit": This is the core guiding principle of the SCO. It emphasizes mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, consultation, respect for cultural diversity, and the pursuit of common development. This "non-Western" approach is often contrasted with Western-led security and political alliances.
    <br>"Three Evils" of Terrorism, Separatism, and Extremism: The fight against these three issues is a central pillar of the SCO's security framework. This focus was a primary motivation for the organization's founding and continues to be a major area of cooperation.
    <br>2. Organizational Structure and Bodies
    <br>The SCO framework is built on a hierarchy of councils and institutions:
    <br>Heads of State Council (HSC): This is the supreme decision-making body. It meets annually to set the overall strategy and direction of the organization.
    <br>Heads of Government Council: This body is responsible for discussing issues of multilateral cooperation, particularly in the economic and trade sectors.
    <br>Council of Ministers of Foreign Affairs: This council addresses day-to-day issues and prepares documents for the Heads of State Council.
    <br>Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS): Headquartered in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, RATS is a permanent body responsible for coordinating the anti-terrorism efforts of the member states. It facilitates intelligence sharing and joint military exercises.
    <br>Secretariat: Located in Beijing, the Secretariat is the main permanent executive body of the SCO. It provides informational, analytical, and organizational support.
    <br>3. Areas of Cooperation
    <br>The SCO framework extends beyond security to cover a wide range of fields:
    <br>Security and Military Cooperation: This is the most established area of cooperation, focusing on counter-terrorism, combating separatism and extremism, and addressing issues like drug trafficking and cybercrime.
    <br>Economic and Trade: The organization aims to promote cooperation in trade, investment, energy, and transportation. A long-term goal is the establishment of a free-trade zone among the member states.
    <br>Digital and Technological Cooperation: The SCO has increasingly focused on digital transformation, including digital infrastructure, cybersecurity, and the development of a "Digital Silk Road."
    <br>Cultural and People-to-People Exchanges: The framework also includes cooperation in education, tourism, and culture to strengthen ties between the member nations.
    <br>In summary, the SCO framework is a flexible, multilateral system that provides a platform for its members to coordinate on a range of security, economic, and political issues, often in contrast to Western-dominated international institutions."

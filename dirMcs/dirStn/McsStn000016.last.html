    <br>">international-organization overview:
    <br>International organizations (IOs) are associations of sovereign states, intergovernmental organizations, or other entities with international scope, which come together voluntarily to achieve common objectives. They play a crucial role in addressing global challenges and promoting international cooperation.
    <br>
    <br>**Types of International Organizations**
    <br>* **Intergovernmental organizations (IGOs)** are formal entities established by treaties or agreements between governments. They have their own legal personalities and are distinct from their member states. Examples include the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, and the International Monetary Fund.
    <br>* **Non-governmental organizations (NGOs)** are private organizations that are not affiliated with any government. They play an important role in advocacy, humanitarian assistance, and development work. Examples include Amnesty International, Oxfam, and Greenpeace.
    <br>* **International organizations of states (IOS)** are a hybrid type of organization that combines elements of both IGOs and NGOs. They are often established by governments but have some degree of autonomy. Examples include the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
    <br>**Purposes of International Organizations**
    <br>
    <br>IOs serve a wide range of purposes, including:
    <br>* **Maintaining international peace and security:** IOs such as the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) work to prevent and resolve conflicts and promote cooperation on security issues.
    <br>* **Promoting human rights and democracy:** IOs such as the United Nations Human Rights Council and the Council of Europe promote and protect human rights and democratic values.
    <br>* **Addressing global economic and social challenges:** IOs such as the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Health Organization work to address global economic and social challenges, such as poverty, hunger, disease, and climate change.
    <br>* **Promoting sustainable development:** IOs such as the United Nations Environment Programme and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations work to promote sustainable development and environmental protection.
    <br>* **Facilitating international cooperation:** IOs provide forums for governments to cooperate on a wide range of issues, from trade and finance to environmental protection and health.
    <br>**Impact of International Organizations**
    <br>
    <br>IOs have had a significant impact on the world, contributing to:
    <br>* **Increased international cooperation:** IOs have facilitated cooperation among governments on a wide range of issues, helping to address global challenges and promote shared interests.
    <br>* **Advancement of human rights:** IOs have played a key role in promoting and protecting human rights around the world.
    <br>* **Economic development:** IOs have helped to promote economic development and trade liberalization, contributing to global economic growth.
    <br>* **Peace and security:** IOs have worked to prevent and resolve conflicts, and to promote peace and security around the world.
    <br>
    <br>Despite their many successes, IOs also face challenges, including:
    <br>* **Ensuring accountability:** IOs must be accountable to their member states and to the public for their actions.
    <br>* **Adapting to a changing world:** IOs must adapt to the rapidly changing international landscape and address new and emerging challenges.
    <br>* **Coordinating with other actors:** IOs must coordinate effectively with other international organizations, national governments, and non-governmental organizations to achieve their goals.
    <br>
    <br>International organizations continue to play an important role in addressing global challenges and promoting international cooperation. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the need for effective IOs will only grow."

  <p id="idOznInlrinldsn">description::
    <br>">international organization international-law:
    <br>**International organizations** and **international law** are closely intertwined concepts. International organizations are legal entities created by states to address shared challenges and pursue common goals. They play a crucial role in developing and implementing international law, which is the body of rules and principles that govern relations between states.
    <br>
    <br>**International organizations** are established through treaties, which are formal agreements between states. Treaties define the purpose, structure, and powers of an international organization. Once an organization is established, it becomes an actor in its own right, with the capacity to enter into contracts, sue and be sued, and own property.
    <br>
    <br>International organizations play a variety of roles in the development and implementation of international law. They can:
    <br>* **Codify international law:** International organizations can codify existing international law by drafting and adopting treaties that consolidate and clarify the existing rules and principles. For example, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) codifies the customary rules of international law relating to the oceans.
    <br>* **Develop new norms of international law:** International organizations can also develop new norms of international law through their resolutions, declarations, and other instruments. These instruments may not be legally binding, but they can nevertheless influence state behavior and set precedents for future legal developments. For example, the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights has been instrumental in the development of international human rights law.
    <br>* **Implement international law:** International organizations can also play a role in implementing international law by monitoring state compliance, providing technical assistance, and resolving disputes. For example, the World Trade Organization (WTO) has a dispute settlement mechanism that helps to resolve trade disputes between states.
    <br>
    <br>In addition to these direct roles, international organizations also contribute to the development and implementation of international law by:
    <br>* **Providing a forum for states to negotiate and adopt treaties:** International organizations provide a neutral forum for states to negotiate and adopt treaties, which are the primary source of international law.
    <br>* **Exchanging information and expertise:** International organizations facilitate the exchange of information and expertise among states, which can help to promote a common understanding of international law.
    <br>* **Raising awareness of international law:** International organizations raise awareness of international law through their publications, conferences, and other activities.
    <br>
    <br>The relationship between international organizations and international law is mutually reinforcing. International law provides the framework for the creation and operation of international organizations, while international organizations play a crucial role in developing and implementing international law."

    <br>">quantity of international-organizations:
    <br>The exact number of international organizations is difficult to determine as there is no single, definitive source for this information. However, the Union of International Associations (UIA) maintains a database of over 68,000 international organizations, both active and inactive. This database includes organizations that meet the UIA's criteria, which are:
    <br>* The organization must have an international scope, meaning that it operates in two or more countries.
    <br>* The organization must have a permanent structure, meaning that it has a staff, an office, and a budget.
    <br>* The organization must have a stated purpose that is not primarily commercial.
    <br>
    <br>Based on the UIA's database, it is estimated that there are over 300 intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) and over 65,000 international non-governmental organizations (INGOs). IGOs are organizations that are created by treaties between governments, such as the United Nations and the World Health Organization. INGOs are organizations that are not created by treaties, but are instead formed by private individuals or groups, such as Amnesty International and the Red Cross.
    <br>
    <br>The number of international organizations has been growing steadily in recent years. This growth is due to a number of factors, including:
    <br>* The increasing globalization of the world economy
    <br>* The increasing complexity of global problems, such as climate change and terrorism
    <br>* The growing recognition of the need for international cooperation to address these problems
    <br>
    <br>International organizations play an important role in global governance. They provide a forum for countries to cooperate on issues of common concern, they develop and implement international norms and standards, and they provide technical assistance and other forms of support to countries."

    <br>"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an international financial institution, headquartered in Washington, D.C., consisting of 190 countries working to foster global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable economic growth, and reduce poverty around the world while periodically depending on the World Bank for its resources.[1] Formed in July 1944,[7] at the Bretton Woods Conference primarily by the ideas of Harry Dexter White and John Maynard Keynes,[8] it came into formal existence in 1945 with 29 member countries and the goal of reconstructing the international monetary system. It now plays a central role in the management of balance of payments difficulties and international financial crises.[9] Countries contribute funds to a pool through a quota system from which countries experiencing balance of payments problems can borrow money. As of 2016, the fund had XDR 477 billion (about US$667 billion).[10]
    <br>Through the fund and other activities such as the gathering of statistics and analysis, surveillance of its members' economies, and the demand for particular policies,[11] the IMF works to improve the economies of its member countries.[12] The organization's objectives stated in the Articles of Agreement are:[13] to promote international monetary co-operation, international trade, high employment, exchange-rate stability, sustainable economic growth, and making resources available to member countries in financial difficulty.[14] IMF funds come from two major sources: quotas and loans. Quotas, which are pooled funds of member nations, generate most IMF funds. The size of a member's quota depends on its economic and financial importance in the world. Nations with greater economic significance have larger quotas. The quotas are increased periodically as a means of boosting the IMF's resources in the form of special drawing rights.[15]
    <br>The current Managing Director (MD) and Chairwoman of the IMF is Bulgarian economist Kristalina Georgieva, who has held the post since October 1, 2019.[16] Gita Gopinath was appointed as Chief Economist of IMF from 1 October 2018. Prior to her appointment at the IMF, Gopinath served as the economic adviser to the Chief Minister of Kerala, India.[17]"

    <br>"The World Health Organization (WHO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for international public health.[1] The WHO Constitution, which establishes the agency's governing structure and principles, states its main objective as "the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health."[2] It is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, with six semi-autonomous regional offices and 150 field offices worldwide.
    <br>The WHO was established by constitution on 7 April 1948,[3] which is commemorated as World Health Day.[4] The first meeting of the World Health Assembly (WHA), the agency's governing body, took place on 24 July 1948. The WHO incorporated the assets, personnel, and duties of the League of Nations' Health Organisation and the Office International d'Hygiène Publique, including the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).[5] Its work began in earnest in 1951 following a significant infusion of financial and technical resources.[6]
    <br>The WHO's broad mandate includes advocating for universal healthcare, monitoring public health risks, coordinating responses to health emergencies, and promoting human health and well being.[7] It provides technical assistance to countries, sets international health standards and guidelines, and collects data on global health issues through the World Health Survey. Its flagship publication, the World Health Report, provides expert assessments of global health topics and health statistics on all nations.[8] The WHO also serves as a forum for summits and discussions on health issues.[1]"

    <br>"The World Trade Organization (WTO) is an intergovernmental organization that regulates and facilitates international trade between nations. It officially commenced operations on 1 January 1995, pursuant to the 1994 Marrakesh Agreement, replacing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which was established in 1948. The WTO is the world's largest international economic organization, with 164 member states representing over 96% of global trade and global GDP.[6][7][8]
    <br>The WTO facilitates trade in goods, services and intellectual property among participating countries by providing a framework for negotiating trade agreements, which usually aim to reduce or eliminate tariffs, quotas, and other restrictions; these agreements are signed by representatives of member governments[9]:fol.9–10 and ratified by their legislatures.[10] The WTO also administers independent dispute resolution for enforcing participants' adherence to trade agreements and resolving trade-related disputes.[11] The organization prohibits discrimination between trading partners, but provides exceptions for environmental protection, national security, and other important goals.[11]
    <br>The WTO is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.[12] Its top decision making body is the Ministerial Conference, which is composed of all member states and usually convenes biannually; consensus is emphasized in all decisions.[13] Day-to-day functions are handled by the General Council, made up of representatives from all members.[14] A Secretariat of over 600 personnel, led by the Director-General and four deputies, provides administrative, professional, and technical services.[15] The WTO's annual budget is roughly 220 million USD, which is contributed by members based on their proportion of international trade.[16]
    <br>Studies show the WTO has boosted trade and reduced trade barriers.[17][18][11][19] It has also influenced trade agreement generally; a 2017 analysis found that the vast majority of preferential trade agreements (PTAs) up to that point explicitly reference the WTO, with substantial portions of text copied from WTO agreements.[20] Goal 10 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals also referenced WTO agreements as instruments of reducing inequality.[21] However, critics contend that the benefits of WTO-facilitated free trade are not shared equally, citing the outcomes of negotiations and data showing a continually widening gap between rich and poor nations.[22][23]"

The WEF's mission is stated as "committed to improving the state of the world by engaging business, political, academic, and other leaders of society to shape global, regional, and industry agendas".[1]
    <br>The WEF hosts an annual meeting at the end of January in Davos, a mountain resort in Graubünden, in the eastern Alps region of Switzerland. The meeting brings together some 3,000 business leaders, international political leaders, economists, celebrities and journalists for up to five days to discuss global issues, across 500 sessions.
    <br>The organization also convenes some six to eight regional meetings each year in locations across Africa, East Asia, Latin America, and India and holds two further annual meetings in China and the United Arab Emirates. Beside meetings, the organization provides a platform for leaders from all stakeholder groups from around the world – business, government and civil society – to collaborate on multiple projects and initiatives.[2] It also produces a series of reports and engages its members in sector-specific initiatives.[3]
    <br>The World Economic Forum and its annual meeting in Davos are criticised regarding the public cost of security, the formation of a wealthy global elite without attachment to the broader societies, undemocratic decision processes, gender issues and a lack of financial transparency."

    <br>"The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement is an international humanitarian movement with approximately 97 million volunteers, members and staff worldwide, which was founded to protect human life and health, to ensure respect for all human beings, and to prevent and alleviate human suffering. Within three distinct organizations that are legally independent from each other, but are united within the movement through common basic principles, objectives, symbols, statutes and governing organisations, there are the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), that is a private humanitarian institution founded in 1863 in Geneva, Switzerland, in particular by Henry Dunant and Gustave Moynier. Its 25-member committee has a unique authority under international humanitarian law to protect the life and dignity of the victims of international and internal armed conflicts. The ICRC was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on three occasions (in 1917, 1944 and 1963).
    <br>The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) was founded in 1919 and today it coordinates between the 190 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies within the Movement, internationally in close cooperation with the National Societies, relief assistance missions responding to large-scale emergencies. The International Federation Secretariat is based in Geneva, Switzerland. In 1963, the Federation (then known as the League of Red Cross Societies) was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize jointly with the ICRC.
    <br>The National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies exist in nearly every country in the world. Currently 190 National Societies are recognized by the ICRC and admitted as full members of the Federation. Each entity works in its home country according to the principles of international humanitarian law and the statutes of the international Movement. Depending on their specific circumstances and capacities, National Societies can take on additional humanitarian tasks that are not directly defined by international humanitarian law or the mandates of the international Movement. They are tightly linked to the respective national health care system by providing emergency medical services in every country."

  <p id="idOznInl010dsn">description::
    <br>"The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC, /ˈoʊpɛk/ OH-pek) is an intergovernmental organization of 13 countries. Founded on 14 September 1960 in Baghdad by the first five members (Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela), it has since 1965 been headquartered in Vienna, Austria, although Austria is not an OPEC member state. As of September 2018, the 13 member countries accounted for an estimated 44 percent of global oil production and 81.5 percent of the world's "proven" oil reserves, giving OPEC a major influence on global oil prices that were previously determined by the so-called "Seven Sisters" grouping of multinational oil companies. A larger group called OPEC+ was formed in late 2016, to have more control on global crude oil market.[5] The demand for OPEC oil has fallen to a 30-year low in the second quarter of 2020.[6]
    <br>The stated mission of the organization is to "coordinate and unify the petroleum policies of its member countries and ensure the stabilization of oil markets, in order to secure an efficient, economic and regular supply of petroleum to consumers, a steady income to producers, and a fair return on capital for those investing in the petroleum industry."[7] The organization is also a significant provider of information about the international oil market. The current OPEC members are the following: Algeria, Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, the Republic of the Congo, Saudi Arabia (the De facto leader), the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. Former OPEC members are Ecuador, Indonesia and Qatar.[8]
    <br>The formation of OPEC marked a turning point toward national sovereignty over natural resources, and OPEC decisions have come to play a prominent role in the global oil market and international relations. The effect can be particularly strong when wars or civil disorders lead to extended interruptions in supply. In the 1970s, restrictions in oil production led to a dramatic rise in oil prices and in the revenue and wealth of OPEC, with long-lasting and far-reaching consequences for the global economy. In the 1980s, OPEC began setting production targets for its member nations; generally, when the targets are reduced, oil prices increase. This has occurred most recently from the organization's 2008, and 2016 decisions to trim oversupply.
    <br>Economists often cite OPEC as a textbook example of a cartel that cooperates to reduce market competition, but one whose consultations are protected by the doctrine of state immunity under international law. In December 2014, "OPEC and the oil men" ranked as #3 on Lloyd's list of "the top 100 most influential people in the shipping industry".[9] However, the influence of OPEC on international trade is periodically challenged by the expansion of non-OPEC energy sources, and by the recurring temptation for individual OPEC countries to exceed production targets and pursue conflicting self-interests.
    <br>In October 2019, Saudi Arabia invited Brazil to join OPEC.[10] The president of Petrobras, Roberto Castello Branco, in an interview in New York, said that being a member of OPEC is not an option currently considered by the Brazilian federal government.[11]"

    <br>The expansion of BRICS to include new members has been met with mixed reactions. Some experts believe that the expansion will dilute the organization's focus and make it more difficult to achieve its goals. Others believe that the expansion will strengthen BRICS and make it a more influential player on the global stage. The ultimate impact of the expansion will depend on how effectively the new members integrate into the organization and how they contribute to its work."

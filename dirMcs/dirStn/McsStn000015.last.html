    <br>">supplier of organization:
    <br>The supplier of an organization refers to an external entity or business that provides goods, services, or raw materials to the organization. Suppliers play a crucial role in the supply chain and overall operations of a company. They can be individuals, other companies, or even government agencies, depending on the nature of the organization and its needs.
    <br>
    <br>Organizations often establish relationships with suppliers to ensure a steady and reliable source of necessary resources. These relationships can be formalized through contracts and agreements that outline terms and conditions such as pricing, delivery schedules, quality standards, and other relevant factors.
    <br>
    <br>The selection of suppliers is an important strategic decision for organizations, as it can impact the cost, quality, and efficiency of their operations. Many businesses evaluate potential suppliers based on criteria such as reliability, reputation, financial stability, ethical practices, and the ability to meet specific requirements.
    <br>
    <br>Effective supplier management is essential for maintaining a smooth and efficient supply chain. This involves ongoing communication, monitoring of performance, and collaboration to address any issues that may arise.
    <br>
    <br>In summary, a supplier is an external entity that provides goods, services, or raw materials to an organization, and managing these relationships is crucial for the success of the organization's operations."

    <br>"Corporate law (also known as business law or enterprise law or sometimes company law) is the body of law governing the rights, relations, and conduct of persons, companies, organizations and businesses. The term refers to the legal practice of law relating to corporations, or to the theory of corporations. Corporate law often describes the law relating to matters which derive directly from the life-cycle of a corporation.[1] It thus encompasses the formation, funding, governance, and death of a corporation."
    <br>[{2020-10-13} https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_law]
    <br>
    <br>">corporate law:
    <br>Corporate law, also known as business law, company law, or enterprise law, is the body of law governing the rights, relations, and conduct of persons, companies, organizations and businesses. It includes the formation, operation, governance, and termination of legal entities.
    <br>
    <br>**Key Areas of Corporate Law**
    <br>* **Corporate Formation:** This area of law deals with the process of creating a corporation, including obtaining a corporate charter, drafting and filing corporate documents, and establishing corporate bylaws.
    <br>* **Corporate Governance:** This area of law governs the internal management of corporations, including the role of shareholders, directors, and officers. It also addresses issues such as corporate ethics, corporate social responsibility, and corporate accountability.
    <br>* **Corporate Finance:** This area of law deals with the raising of capital by corporations, including the issuance of stocks, bonds, and other securities. It also covers mergers, acquisitions, and other corporate transactions.
    <br>* **Corporate Liability:** This area of law addresses the legal obligations of corporations and their officers and directors. It includes issues such as tort liability, contract liability, and securities law liability.
    <br>
    <br>**Importance of Corporate Law**
    <br>Corporate law is important for several reasons:
    <br>1. **It protects investors and shareholders:** Corporate law provides a framework for corporations to operate in a fair and transparent manner, which helps to protect the interests of investors and shareholders.
    <br>2. **It promotes competition:** Corporate law helps to ensure that corporations compete fairly and that markets are open and accessible to all.
    <br>3. **It protects creditors:** Corporate law protects the rights of creditors by ensuring that corporations fulfill their financial obligations.
    <br>4. **It promotes economic growth:** Corporate law contributes to economic growth by creating a stable and predictable environment for businesses to operate.
    <br>
    <br>**Types of Corporations**
    <br>There are several different types of corporations, each with its own legal structure and governance. The most common types of corporations include:
    <br>* **C corporations:** C corporations are for-profit corporations that are taxed separately from their shareholders. They are the most common type of corporation for large businesses.
    <br>* **S corporations:** S corporations are for-profit corporations that are taxed as partnerships or LLCs. This means that the corporation's profits and losses are passed through to the shareholders, who are then taxed on their individual returns. S corporations are a popular choice for small businesses.
    <br>* **Limited Liability Companies (LLCs):** LLCs are hybrid entities that combine the characteristics of corporations and partnerships. LLCs offer limited liability protection to their members, and their profits are taxed as pass-through entities. LLCs are a popular choice for small businesses and startups.
    <br>* **Nonprofit Corporations:** Nonprofit corporations are organized for a charitable or other social purpose, and they are not allowed to distribute profits to their members. Nonprofit corporations are exempt from federal income tax, but they must file annual tax returns.
    <br>
    <br>**Regulation of Corporate Law**
    <br>Corporate law is regulated by both state and federal law. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the primary federal agency responsible for overseeing corporate law. The SEC has a wide range of authority, including the power to register and regulate securities offerings, investigate corporate fraud, and enforce insider trading laws.
    <br>In addition to the SEC, there are a number of other federal and state agencies that have jurisdiction over corporate law. These agencies include the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and the state attorneys general.
    <br>
    <br>**Conclusion**
    <br>Corporate law is a complex and ever-evolving area of law. It is important for businesses to have a basic understanding of corporate law to ensure that they are operating in compliance with the law. Businesses should also consult with an attorney to address specific legal issues.

    <br>">health of organization:
    <br>Organizational health is a multifaceted concept that encompasses an organization's ability to effectively operate, achieve its goals, and adapt to change. It is influenced by a range of factors, including employee engagement, leadership effectiveness, communication, culture, and decision-making processes.
    <br>
    <br>**Key indicators of organizational health**
    <br>* **Employee engagement:** A healthy organization has employees who are engaged in their work, feel connected to their colleagues, and are motivated to contribute to the organization's success.
    <br>* **Leadership effectiveness:** Effective leaders set a clear vision, provide support and direction, and foster a positive and supportive work environment.
    <br>* **Communication:** Open and clear communication is essential for ensuring that everyone in the organization is on the same page and that important information is shared effectively.
    <br>* **Culture:** A healthy organizational culture is one that is based on shared values, trust, and respect. It promotes collaboration, innovation, and accountability.
    <br>* **Decision-making processes:** Effective decision-making processes involve clear roles, involvement of stakeholders, and a focus on data and analysis.
    <br>
    <br>**Benefits of a healthy organization**
    <br>* **Improved employee engagement and productivity:** Healthy organizations are more likely to have engaged employees who are motivated and productive.
    <br>* **Increased customer satisfaction:** When employees are engaged and productive, they are more likely to provide excellent customer service.
    <br>* **Enhanced innovation and creativity:** Healthy organizations are more likely to foster a culture of innovation and creativity, leading to new products, services, and processes.
    <br>* **Improved financial performance:** Healthy organizations are more likely to achieve their financial goals and outperform their competitors.
    <br>
    <br>**How to assess your organization's health**
    <br>There are a number of ways to assess your organization's health. One approach is to conduct surveys or focus groups with employees to gather their feedback on various aspects of the organization, such as leadership, communication, and culture. You can also benchmark your organization against industry standards to identify areas for improvement.
    <br>
    <br>**Strategies for improving organizational health**
    <br>Once you have a good understanding of your organization's health, you can develop strategies to improve it. Here are a few examples of effective strategies:
    <br>* **Invest in employee engagement:** Provide opportunities for learning and development, offer flexible work arrangements, and recognize and reward employee contributions.
    <br>* **Develop strong leadership:** Ensure that leaders are equipped with the skills and training they need to be effective, and provide them with opportunities for growth.
    <br>* **Enhance communication:** Encourage open and honest communication across all levels of the organization, and use a variety of communication channels to reach different audiences.
    <br>* **Create a positive culture:** Foster a culture of trust, respect, and collaboration. Celebrate successes, and address issues promptly and effectively.
    <br>* **Improve decision-making processes:** Ensure that decisions are made in a transparent and accountable manner, and involve stakeholders in the process.

    <br>One interpretation of what is informal is whatever is not registered with some arm of government.
    <br>The problems with this criterion are obvious.
    <br>Different countries have different practices on registration.
    <br>Some may insist that all activities, however small and casual, should be registered; others may be more pragmatic and require activities to be registered only when their turnover exceeds a given amount or when the number of employees exceeds a given number.
    <br>Further, whatever the official requirements for registration, the degree of compliance with the requirements will vary according to the extent to which they are enforced in practice.
    <br>A definition of the informal sector based on registration is therefore not going to give international comparability or, possibly, comparability over time within a country if the requirements for registration or degree of compliance with the requirements vary"

    <br>">evaluation of organization:
    <br>Evaluating an organization is a crucial process that provides valuable insights into its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT analysis). This evaluation can be used to identify areas for improvement, make informed decisions, and ensure the organization is aligned with its strategic goals.
    <br>
    <br>**Key Aspects of Organizational Evaluation**
    <br>1. **Mission and Vision:** Evaluate whether the organization's mission and vision are clearly defined, relevant to its current environment, and inspiring to its employees.
    <br>2. **Values:** Assess whether the organization's values are actively upheld and reflected in its practices, decisions, and behaviors.
    <br>3. **Goals and Objectives:** Evaluate whether the organization's goals and objectives are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound), aligned with the mission and vision, and supported by adequate resources.
    <br>4. **Performance Measurements:** Assess the organization's performance against its goals and objectives using relevant metrics, such as financial performance, customer satisfaction, employee engagement, and market share.
    <br>5. **Leadership:** Evaluate the effectiveness of the leadership team in setting direction, motivating employees, and fostering a positive organizational culture.
    <br>6. **Decision-Making Processes:** Assess the organization's decision-making processes, ensuring they are transparent, inclusive, and based on sound information and analysis.
    <br>7. **Culture and Engagement:** Evaluate the organization's culture, considering its values, communication, teamwork, and employee engagement.
    <br>8. **Sustainability and Innovation:** Assess the organization's commitment to sustainability practices, innovation, and adaptability to changing market conditions.
    <br>
    <br>**Tools for Organizational Evaluation**
    <br>1. **Self-Assessment:** Organizations can conduct internal self-assessments using questionnaires, surveys, and interviews to gather feedback from employees, customers, and stakeholders.
    <br>2. **External Audits:** Engage external consultants or auditors to provide objective and independent reviews of the organization's processes, systems, and performance.
    <br>3. **Performance Benchmarking:** Compare the organization's performance against industry benchmarks or similar organizations to identify areas for improvement or differentiation.
    <br>
    <br>**Benefits of Organizational Evaluation**
    <br>1. **Improved Performance:** Identify areas for improvement and make strategic adjustments to enhance organizational effectiveness.
    <br>2. **Increased Efficiency:** Optimize resource allocation, processes, and operations to maximize value and reduce waste.
    <br>3. **Enhanced Accountability:** Hold individuals and departments accountable for their contributions to achieving organizational goals.
    <br>4. **Strengthened Culture:** Foster a positive, engaged, and productive organizational culture that attracts and retains top talent.
    <br>5. **Greater Resilience:** Prepare for future challenges and adapt to changing market conditions through informed decision-making.
    <br>
    <br>Organizational evaluation is an ongoing process that should be conducted regularly to ensure the organization remains aligned with its strategic goals, adapts to changing external factors, and continuously improves its performance."

  <p id="idOznPdnesgdsn">description::
    <br>">ESG:
    <br>ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance, and it refers to a set of criteria used to evaluate a company's performance in these three areas. ESG factors are often considered by investors, analysts, and other stakeholders to assess the sustainability and ethical impact of a business. Here's a breakdown of each component:
    <br>
    <br>1. **Environmental (E):** This category focuses on a company's impact on the environment. It includes considerations such as a company's carbon footprint, energy efficiency, waste management practices, water usage, and overall environmental sustainability. Companies with strong environmental performance are often those that prioritize eco-friendly practices and demonstrate a commitment to reducing their environmental impact.
    <br>
    <br>2. **Social (S):** The social aspect of ESG evaluates a company's relationships with its employees, customers, suppliers, and the communities in which it operates. Social factors include labor practices, employee relations, diversity and inclusion, human rights, and community engagement. Companies with strong social performance prioritize fair labor practices, diversity, employee well-being, and positive community contributions.
    <br>
    <br>3. **Governance (G):** Governance relates to the way a company is managed and controlled. Key governance factors include the composition and structure of the board of directors, executive compensation, transparency, ethical business practices, and adherence to legal and regulatory standards. Strong governance is associated with effective decision-making, ethical behavior, and accountability.
    <br>
    <br>Investors and financial institutions increasingly consider ESG factors as part of their investment strategies, recognizing that companies with strong ESG performance may be better positioned for long-term success and are less likely to face environmental, social, and governance-related risks. ESG considerations are integrated into investment decisions, and there is a growing demand for transparency and standardized reporting of ESG metrics from companies.
    <br>
    <br>ESG investing reflects a broader shift toward sustainable and responsible investing practices, where financial performance is evaluated alongside environmental and social impact. Many companies now publish ESG reports to communicate their efforts and performance in these areas to stakeholders."

    <br>"Your DUNS number only reveals credit information gathered by one credit bureau—Dun & Bradstreet. Originally known as the Mercantile Agency, Dun & Bradstreet is one of America’s oldest companies. Its founder, Lewis Tappan, created it in 1841 for the purpose of helping merchants establish the creditworthiness of potential customers.
    <br>Today, Dun & Bradstreet keeps track of over 265 million businesses worldwide. Over 100 million of those businesses have been assigned a DUNS number. The federal government adopted the DUNS number as its principal business identifier in 1994.
    <br>In 1998, the DUNS number was incorporated as the federal government’s contractor identification code. This means that companies without a DUNS number cannot do business with the federal government. This makes a DUNS number invaluable for many small businesses, since government contracts are often stable, lucrative sources of income."

    <br>"The North American Industry Classification System or NAICS (pronounced "nakes"[1]) is a classification of business establishments by type of economic activity (process of production). It is used by government and business in Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America. It has largely replaced the older Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system, except in some government agencies, such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
    <br>An establishment is typically a single physical location, though administratively distinct operations at a single location may be treated as distinct establishments. Each establishment is classified to an industry according to the primary business activity taking place there. NAICS does not offer guidance on the classification of enterprises (companies) which are composed of multiple establishments."

    <br>"The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) is a system for classifying industries by a four-digit code. Established in the United States in 1937, it is used by government agencies to classify industry areas. The SIC system is also used by agencies in other countries, e.g., by the United Kingdom's Companies House.[1]
    <br>In the United States, the SIC code has been replaced by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS code), which was released in 1997.[2] Some U.S. government departments and agencies, such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), continued to use SIC codes through at least 2019.[3]
    <br>The SIC code for an establishment, that is, a workplace with a U.S. address, was determined by the industry appropriate for the overall largest product lines of the company or organization of which the establishment was a part. The later NAICS classification system has a different concept, assigning establishments into categories based on each one's output.[4][5]"

    <br>">market value of sector:
    <br>The market value of a sector is the total market capitalization of all companies in that sector. Market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the number of outstanding shares of a company by its current share price. The market value of a sector is a measure of the overall size and importance of that sector in the economy.
    <br>Here are the market values of the 11 major market sectors as of October 4, 2023:
    <br>1. Technology: $7.42 trillion
    <br>2. Consumer discretionary: $5.79 trillion
    <br>3. Financials: $5.43 trillion
    <br>4. Communication services: $4.80 trillion
    <br>5. Health care: $4.37 trillion
    <br>6. Industrials: $3.90 trillion
    <br>7. Materials: $3.37 trillion
    <br>8. Consumer staples: $3.17 trillion
    <br>9. Utilities: $2.49 trillion
    <br>10. Real estate: $2.23 trillion
    <br>11. Energy: $1.94 trillion
    <br>As you can see, the technology sector is the largest by market value, followed by consumer discretionary, financials, communication services, and healthcare. These five sectors make up over half of the total market value of all stocks.
    <br>The market value of a sector can change over time as new companies enter the sector, existing companies grow or shrink, and economic conditions change. For example, the technology sector has seen its market value grow rapidly in recent years, while the energy sector has seen its market value decline.
    <br>The market value of a sector can be a useful indicator of the overall health of the economy. A growing sector is often a sign of economic growth, while a declining sector can be a sign of economic weakness. However, it is important to note that the market value of a sector is just one piece of information, and investors should also consider other factors such as company-specific fundamentals and economic trends when making investment decisions."

    <br>">economic-policies per sector:
    <br>Economic policies are government actions or interventions intended to influence the economy. These policies can affect a wide range of economic activities, including production, consumption, investment, and international trade. Different economic sectors have different policy needs, and governments often tailor their policies to the specific needs of each sector.
    <br>**Agriculture**
    <br>The agricultural sector is a key economic driver in many countries, and governments often use policies to support the sector. These policies may include:
    <br>* **Subsidies:** Governments may provide subsidies to farmers to help them cover the costs of production, such as fertilizers, seeds, and equipment.
    <br>* **Infrastructure development:** Governments may invest in infrastructure development, such as roads, irrigation systems, and storage facilities, to improve the productivity of the agricultural sector.
    <br>* **Market access:** Governments may work to improve market access for agricultural products, both domestically and internationally. This may involve negotiating trade agreements or providing technical assistance to farmers to help them meet export standards.
    <br>**Manufacturing**
    <br>The manufacturing sector is another important economic sector, and governments often use policies to support it. These policies may include:
    <br>* **Tax breaks:** Governments may provide tax breaks to manufacturing companies to encourage them to invest and create jobs.
    <br>* **Government procurement:** Governments may give preference to domestic manufacturing companies when they are awarding contracts.
    <br>* **Research and development (R&D) subsidies:** Governments may provide subsidies to manufacturing companies to fund R&D activities, which can help them develop new products and processes.
    <br>**Financial Services**
    <br>The financial services sector is crucial for the functioning of the economy, and governments often use policies to regulate it. These policies may include:
    <br>* **Bank regulation:** Governments may regulate banks to ensure that they are safe and sound, and to prevent them from engaging in risky activities that could harm the economy.
    <br>* **Financial market regulation:** Governments may regulate financial markets to prevent fraud and manipulation, and to ensure that investors are protected.
    <br>* **Monetary policy:** Governments may use monetary policy to manage inflation and interest rates, which can affect the overall health of the economy.
    <br>**Tourism**
    <br>The tourism sector is a major source of income for many countries, and governments often use policies to encourage tourism. These policies may include:
    <br>* **Tax breaks for hotels and other tourism businesses:** Governments may provide tax breaks to hotels and other tourism businesses to make them more competitive.
    <br>* **Investment in tourism infrastructure:** Governments may invest in tourism infrastructure, such as airports, roads, and tourist attractions, to make it easier for tourists to visit the country.
    <br>* **Marketing and promotion:** Governments may invest in marketing and promotion to attract tourists to the country.
    <br>**Education**
    <br>Education is a key investment in the future of an economy, and governments often use policies to improve education. These policies may include:
    <br>* **Investment in public schools:** Governments may invest in public schools to improve the quality of education. This may involve hiring more teachers, providing better facilities, and developing new curriculums.
    <br>* **Funding for higher education:** Governments may provide funding for higher education to make it more affordable for students.
    <br>* **Tuition subsidies:** Governments may provide tuition subsidies to students from low-income families.
    <br>**Other Sectors**
    <br>In addition to the sectors discussed above, there are many other sectors that governments use policies to support. These sectors may include:
    <br>* **Healthcare:** Governments may provide healthcare services directly or by providing subsidies to private healthcare providers.
    <br>* **Transportation:** Governments may invest in transportation infrastructure, such as roads, railways, and airports.
    <br>* **Energy:** Governments may regulate the energy sector to ensure that it is reliable, affordable, and environmentally sustainable."

    <br>">types of economic sectors:
    <br>Economic sectors are broad categories of economic activity that are based on the type of goods or services that are produced. The five main economic sectors are:
    <br>
    <br>**Primary sector:** This sector is responsible for extracting raw materials from the natural environment. This includes activities such as mining, fishing, and forestry.
    <br>**Secondary sector:** This sector is responsible for converting raw materials into finished goods. This includes activities such as manufacturing, construction, and utilities.
    <br>**Tertiary sector:** This sector is responsible for providing services to consumers and businesses. This includes activities such as retail, healthcare, and education.
    <br>**Quaternary sector:** This sector is responsible for providing the knowledge and information that is necessary to support the other sectors of the economy. This includes activities such as research and development, and technology.
    <br>**Quinary sector:** This sector is responsible for the most specialized and high-level services, such as management consulting, investment banking, and healthcare.
    <br>
    <br>The composition of an economy's sectors can change over time. For example, as a country develops, the secondary and tertiary sectors tend to grow, while the primary sector shrinks. This is because as people become more affluent, they demand more manufactured goods and services.
    <br>
    <br>The relative size of each sector can also vary from country to country. For example, in countries with abundant natural resources, the primary sector may be larger than in countries with fewer natural resources.
    <br>
    <br>Understanding the composition of an economy's sectors can be helpful for making economic decisions. For example, a government may want to invest in education and training to support the growth of the quaternary sector."

    <br>">economic sectors:
    <br>The economy is typically divided into various sectors to organize and analyze different aspects of economic activity. These sectors include:
    <br>
    <br>1. **Primary Sector**: This involves the extraction and production of raw materials, such as agriculture, mining, forestry, and fishing. It forms the base of the economy and is fundamental in less developed economies.
    <br>
    <br>2. **Secondary Sector**: This sector is concerned with the processing of raw materials obtained from the primary sector. This transformation results in goods production and includes industries like manufacturing, construction, and production.
    <br>
    <br>3. **Tertiary Sector**: Also known as the service sector, it involves the provision of services instead of goods. This sector includes retail, entertainment, financial services, healthcare, and education.
    <br>
    <br>4. **Quaternary Sector**: This is a more specialized part of the tertiary sector and involves the intellectual aspect of the economy, such as information technology, research and development (R&D), and consulting.
    <br>
    <br>5. **Quinary Sector**: This sector includes the highest levels of decision-making and includes top executives or officials in government, science, universities, nonprofit, healthcare, culture, and the media.
    <br>
    <br>Each sector plays a crucial role in the economy, contributing to its growth and stability. The significance of each sector can vary greatly from country to country, depending on the level of economic development. Developed countries tend to have a smaller primary sector and a larger tertiary and quaternary sector, reflecting a higher level of economic advancement and a greater focus on services and knowledge-based activities."

    <br>">industry vs sector:
    <br>The terms "industry" and "sector" are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct meanings in the context of economics and business.
    <br>
    <br>**Industry** refers to a specific group of companies that produce similar products or services. For instance, the automotive industry comprises companies like Ford, Toyota, and General Motors, all of which manufacture and sell cars. Similarly, the healthcare industry encompasses hospitals, clinics, and pharmaceutical companies that provide medical services and treatments.
    <br>
    <br>**Sector**, on the other hand, is a broader classification that groups together industries with similar characteristics. For example, the manufacturing sector encompasses industries that produce physical goods, such as the automotive, electronics, and textiles industries. Similarly, the service sector includes industries that provide intangible services, such as the healthcare, financial, and hospitality industries.
    <br>
    <br>Here's a table summarizing the key differences between industry and sector:
    <br>| Feature | Industry | Sector |
    <br>| Definition | A specific group of companies that produce similar products or services. | A broader classification that groups together industries with similar characteristics. |
    <br>| Scope | Narrower, focusing on a specific type of product or service. | Wider, encompassing multiple industries with shared characteristics. |
    <br>| Examples | Automotive, healthcare, technology, finance | Manufacturing, service, energy, consumer goods |
    <br>
    <br>Here's an analogy that might help illustrate the difference:
    <br>Imagine an economy as a large city, with different industries representing distinct neighborhoods. The automotive industry would be like a neighborhood with car dealerships, repair shops, and manufacturing plants. Similarly, the healthcare industry would be like a neighborhood with hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies. The manufacturing sector, on the other hand, would be like a region of the city that encompasses multiple neighborhoods, such as the automotive, electronics, and textiles industries.
    <br>
    <br>In summary, an industry is a more specific term that focuses on a particular group of companies, while a sector is a broader term that categorizes industries based on shared characteristics. Understanding the distinction between industry and sector is crucial for analyzing economic trends, conducting market research, and making informed investment decisions."

    <br>The term "narrow public sector" is less commonly used and has a somewhat ambiguous definition. It can be interpreted in two ways:
    <br>**1. A more restricted definition of the public sector:** In this context, the narrow public sector would encompass only the core government institutions, such as ministries, departments, and agencies. These organizations are directly accountable to the government and play a central role in formulating and implementing public policies.
    <br>**2. A smaller subset of the broader public sector:** This interpretation views the narrow public sector as a subset of the broader public sector, excluding organizations that operate with more autonomy and flexibility. This could include certain non-profit organizations, Crown corporations, or quasi-governmental agencies that receive public funding but enjoy greater independence in their operations.
    <br>The distinction between the narrow and broader public sectors is not always clear-cut, as the boundaries between these categories can vary depending on the specific context and the country's institutional arrangements. However, both perspectives highlight the diversity of organizations that contribute to the public sector's role in providing essential services, promoting social welfare, and supporting economic development."

    <br>"A military, also known collectively as armed forces, is a heavily armed, highly organized force primarily intended for warfare. It is typically officially authorized and maintained by a sovereign state, with its members identifiable by their distinct military uniform. It may consist of one or more military branches such as an army, navy, air force, space force, marines, or coast guard. The main task of the military is usually defined as defence of the state and its interests against external armed threats.
    <br>In broad usage, the terms "armed forces" and "military" are often treated as synonymous, although in technical usage a distinction is sometimes made in which a country's armed forces may include both its military and other paramilitary forces. There are various forms of irregular military forces, not belonging to a recognized state; though they share many attributes with regular military forces, they are less often referred to as simply "military"."

The term is most commonly associated with the police forces of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. Police forces are often defined as being separate from the military and other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing.[3] Police forces are usually public sector services, funded through taxes."

    <br>"The public sector (also called the state sector) is the part of the economy composed of both public services and public enterprises.
    <br>Public sectors include public goods and governmental services such as the military, law enforcement, infrastructure (public roads, bridges, tunnels, water supply, sewers, electrical grids, telecommunications, etc.), public transit, public education, along with health care and those working for the government itself, such as elected officials. The public sector might provide services that a non-payer cannot be excluded from (such as street lighting), services which benefit all of society rather than just the individual who uses the service.[1] Public enterprises, or state-owned enterprises, are self-financing commercial enterprises that are under public ownership which provide various private goods and services for sale and usually operate on a commercial basis.
    <br>Organizations that are not part of the public sector are either a part of the private sector or voluntary sector. The private sector is composed of the economic sectors that are intended to earn a profit for the owners of the enterprise. The voluntary, civic or social sector concerns a diverse array of non-profit organizations emphasizing civil society."

    <br>"The kind-of-activity unit (KAU) is a part of an enterprise. The KAU groups together all the offices, production facilities etc. of an enterprise, which contribute to the performance of a specific economic activity defined at class level (four digits) of the European classification of economic activities (NACE Rev. 2.) For example, a kind-of-activity unit might be the combination of all parts of a metal producing enterprise that produce copper (class 24.44 in NACE Rev. 2); within the same enterprise there might be another KAU consisting of those parts that produce aluminium (class 24.42 in NACE Rev. 2). In order to statistically subdivide enterprises into KAUs the enterprise's information system must be capable of indicating or calculating for each KAU at least the value of production, intermediate consumption, manpower costs, the operating surplus, employment and gross fixed capital formation.
    <br>The purpose of the KAU is to improve the homogeneity of statistical surveys by economic activity. In the above example, without the use of KAUs, it would be necessary to classify the enterprise either as a copper manufacturer or as an aluminium manufacturer. In such a way rather diverse enterprises might be considered to engage in the same economic activity which would make statistical results less clear and comparable.
    <br>The local part of a kind of activity units is called local kind-of-activity unit (LKAU), the term establishment is common as well, e.g. in SNA or ISIC."

    <br>"An enterprise is an organisational unit producing goods or services which has a certain degree of autonomy in decision-making. An enterprise can carry out more than one economic activity and it can be situated at more than one location. An enterprise may consist out of one or more legal units.
    <br>Legal units include legal persons whose existence is recognized by law independently of the individuals or institutions which may own them or are members of them, such as general partnerships, private limited partnerships, limited liability companies, incorporated companies etc. Legal units as well include natural persons who are engaged in an economic activity in their own right, such as the owner and operator of a shop or a garage, a lawyer or a self-employed handicrafts-man.
    <br>Most enterprises consist out of one legal unit. According to Eurostat estimations only a very small share of enterprises comprise more than one legal unit. However, in terms of employment or value added these enterprises cover a huge part of the economy. Many of the big companies quoted at the stock exchange are on top of a chain of control of a big number of legal units.
    <br>A legal unit may own a second legal unit and this second legal unit may carry out activities solely for this first legal unit. E.g. legal unit A, a limited liability, produces particular goods and legal unit B, a limited liability as well, solely sells these goods. Both units have the same management. In this case they are seen as one single enterprise. Another example may be that legal unit C employs the staff and legal unit D owns the means of production like machines and buildings. A third legal unit E may own and manage these two legal units. Only the units C, D and E together can produce something and hence are to be counted as one enterprise.
    <br>Reasons for splitting the organisational unit enterprise into more than one legal unit can be manifold: avoiding taxes or liabilities, different salaries according to the collective wage agreement or avoiding the publication of annual reports are among them. For example, an enterprise with a certain activity might be able to save expenses, if the wages in the collective wage agreement of this activity are higher than e.g. in logistics. In that case it could make sense to single out the transport capacities of this enterprise into a special limited liability. While in the practical organisation of the enterprise nothing has changed, it now legally consists out of two legal units.
    <br>In parallel globalisation has contributed further to more complex structures of enterprises. Being active on a market in a country very often requires an enterprise to have a legal unit in that country. The legal units of such an enterprise may be centrally managed from one country, the book-keeping may be carried out centrally from another country, R&D may be done in a country with high wages, parts of the production in countries with low wages. European business statistics serves European and national purposes, data collection in the European Statistical System is organised nationally. In this set-up only the national parts of a multi-national enterprise are registered in statistics and their European parts have to be aggregated to obtain European aggregates. Multi-national enterprises are often very big enterprises with a huge impact on statistics in terms of employment and value added . Thus, a good quality of multi-national enterprise data is crucial for a good quality of European business statistics and necessitates a stepping-up of the collaboration among the European Statistical System. This collaboration is organised in the form of European profiling, a process to delineate complex and large enterprises."

    <br>">primary-sector vs agricultural-sector:
    <br>The primary sector and the agricultural sector are often used interchangeably, but there is a subtle difference between the two terms.
    <br>**The primary sector** is the broadest category of economic activity, encompassing all industries that involve the extraction or production of raw materials from nature. This includes agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining, and quarrying.
    <br>**The agricultural sector** is a narrower subcategory of the primary sector, specifically focused on the production of food from plants and animals. This includes crop farming, livestock production, horticulture, and aquaculture.
    <br>In other words, all agriculture is part of the primary sector, but not all primary sector activities are agriculture. For example, mining and forestry are primary sector activities that are not agriculture.
    <br>Here is a table summarizing the key differences between the primary sector and the agricultural sector:
    <br>| Feature | Primary Sector | Agricultural Sector |
    <br>| Definition | The broadest category of economic activity, encompassing the extraction or production of raw materials from nature. | A subcategory of the primary sector focused on the production of food from plants and animals. |
    <br>| Key activities | Agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining, quarrying. | Crop farming, livestock production, horticulture, aquaculture. |
    <br>| Products | Raw materials, such as timber, minerals, and agricultural produce. | Food, such as fruits, vegetables, meat, and dairy products. |

    <br>">is utilities a non-service-sector?:
    <br>Utilities are often classified as a non-service sector, but this is not entirely accurate. While utilities do not traditionally fit into the traditional definition of a service sector, they do provide essential services to the public. This makes them a unique sector that straddles the line between services and industries.
    <br>In some countries, utilities are classified as a part of the secondary sector of the economy, which includes manufacturing and construction. This is because utilities companies often operate large-scale infrastructure projects, such as power plants and pipelines. However, utilities also provide services, such as electricity distribution and customer support.
    <br>For this reason, it is more accurate to consider utilities as a cross-sectoral industry. They have aspects of both the secondary and tertiary sectors, and they play a vital role in the economy as a whole.
    <br>Here is a table summarizing the classification of utilities:
    <br>| Classification | Description |
    <br>| Secondary sector (manufacturing, construction) | Utilities companies often operate large-scale infrastructure projects, such as power plants and pipelines. |
    <br>| Tertiary sector (services) | Utilities companies provide essential services to the public, such as electricity distribution and customer support. |
    <br>| Cross-sectoral industry | Utilities have aspects of both the secondary and tertiary sectors. |
    <br>Ultimately, the classification of utilities is a matter of debate. However, there is no doubt that they are a vital industry that plays a crucial role in the economy."

    <br>">is utilities a non-service-sector?
    <br>Utilities are not part of the non-service sector. They are, in fact, a core component of the service sector. The non-service sector typically refers to parts of the economy that are involved in the production of goods rather than services. This includes:
    <br>1. **Primary Sector**: This includes industries like agriculture, mining, forestry, and fishing, which are involved in the extraction and production of raw materials.
    <br>2. **Secondary Sector**: This encompasses manufacturing and industrial activities, where raw materials are transformed into finished goods.
    <br>Utilities, on the other hand, fall under the **Tertiary Sector**, also known as the service sector. This sector is focused on providing services rather than goods. Utilities provide essential services such as water, electricity, natural gas, waste management, and telecommunication services. These are integral to the functioning of both the everyday lives of individuals and the operation of other sectors of the economy. Thus, utilities are firmly within the service sector."

    <br>"A trust is a three-party fiduciary relationship in which the first party, the trustor or settlor, transfers ("settles") a property (often but not necessarily a sum of money) upon the second party (the trustee) for the benefit of the third party, the beneficiary.[1]
    <br>A testamentary trust is created by a will and arises after the death of the settlor. An inter vivos trust is created during the settlor's lifetime by a trust instrument. A trust may be revocable or irrevocable; in the United States, a trust is presumed to be irrevocable unless the instrument or will creating it states it is revocable, except in California, Oklahoma and Texas, in which trusts are presumed to be revocable until the instrument or will creating them states they are irrevocable. An irrevocable trust can be "broken" (revoked) only by a judicial proceeding.
    <br>The trustee is the legal owner of the property in trust, as fiduciary for the beneficiary or beneficiaries who is/are the equitable owner(s) of the trust property. Trustees thus have a fiduciary duty to manage the trust to the benefit of the equitable owners. They must provide a regular accounting of trust income and expenditures. Trustees may be compensated and be reimbursed their expenses. A court of competent jurisdiction can remove a trustee who breaches his/her fiduciary duty. Some breaches of fiduciary duty can be charged and tried as criminal offences in a court of law.
    <br>A trustee can be a natural person, a business entity or a public body. A trust in the United States may be subject to federal and state taxation.
    <br>A trust is created by a settlor, who transfers title to some or all of his or her property to a trustee, who then holds title to that property in trust for the benefit of the beneficiaries.[2] The trust is governed by the terms under which it was created. In most jurisdictions, this requires a contractual trust agreement or deed. It is possible for a single individual to assume the role of more than one of these parties, and for multiple individuals to share a single role.[citation needed] For example, in a living trust it is common for the grantor to be both a trustee and a lifetime beneficiary while naming other contingent beneficiaries.[citation needed]
    <br>Trusts have existed since Roman times and have become one of the most important innovations in property law.[3] Trust law has evolved through court rulings differently in different states, so statements in this article are generalizations; understanding the jurisdiction-specific case law involved is tricky. Some U.S. states are adapting the Uniform Trust Code to codify and harmonize their trust laws, but state-specific variations still remain.
    <br>An owner placing property into trust turns over part of his or her bundle of rights to the trustee, separating the property's legal ownership and control from its equitable ownership and benefits. This may be done for tax reasons or to control the property and its benefits if the settlor is absent, incapacitated, or deceased. Testamentary trusts may be created in wills, defining how money and property will be handled for children or other beneficiaries.
    <br>While the trustee is given legal title to the trust property, in accepting title the trustee owes a number of fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries. The primary duties owed include the duty of loyalty, the duty of prudence, and the duty of impartiality.[4] Trustees may be held to a very high standard of care in their dealings in order to enforce their behavior. To ensure beneficiaries receive their due, trustees are subject to a number of ancillary duties in support of the primary duties, including duties of openness and transparency, and duties of recordkeeping, accounting, and disclosure. In addition, a trustee has a duty to know, understand, and abide by the terms of the trust and relevant law. The trustee may be compensated and have expenses reimbursed, but otherwise must turn over all profits from the trust properties.
    <br>There are strong restrictions regarding a trustee with a conflict of interest. Courts can reverse a trustee's actions, order profits returned, and impose other sanctions if they find a trustee has failed in any of its duties. Such a failure is termed a breach of trust and can leave a neglectful or dishonest trustee with severe liabilities for its failures. It is highly advisable for both settlors and trustees to seek qualified legal counsel prior to entering into a trust agreement."

    <br>"In law a settlor is a person who settles property on trust law for the benefit of beneficiaries. In some legal systems, a settlor is also referred to as a trustor, or occasionally, a grantor or donor.[a] Where the trust is a testamentary trust, the settlor is usually referred to as the testator. The settlor may also be the trustee of the trust (where he declares that he holds his own property on trusts) or a third party may be the trustee (where he transfers the property to the trustee on trusts). In the common law of England and Wales, it has been held, controversially, that where a trustee declares an intention to transfer trust property to a trust of which he is one of several trustees, that is a valid settlement notwithstanding the property is not vested in the other trustees.[1]"

  <p id="idOznPdn002att008prpldsn">The cooperative principles are guidelines by which cooperatives put their values into practice.
    <br>1. Voluntary and Open Membership
    <br>Cooperatives are voluntary organisations, open to all persons able to use their services and willing to accept the responsibilities of membership, without gender, social, racial, political or religious discrimination.
    <br>
    <br>2. Democratic Member Control
    <br>Cooperatives are democratic organisations controlled by their members, who actively participate in setting their policies and making decisions. Men and women serving as elected representatives are accountable to the membership. In primary cooperatives members have equal voting rights (one member, one vote) and cooperatives at other levels are also organised in a democratic manner.
    <br>
    <br>3. Member Economic Participation
    <br>Members contribute equitably to, and democratically control, the capital of their cooperative. At least part of that capital is usually the common property of the cooperative. Members usually receive limited compensation, if any, on capital subscribed as a condition of membership. Members allocate surpluses for any or all of the following purposes: developing their cooperative, possibly by setting up reserves, part of which at least would be indivisible; benefiting members in proportion to their transactions with the cooperative; and supporting other activities approved by the membership.
    <br>
    <br>4. Autonomy and Independence
    <br>Cooperatives are autonomous, self-help organisations controlled by their members. If they enter into agreements with other organisations, including governments, or raise capital from external sources, they do so on terms that ensure democratic control by their members and maintain their cooperative autonomy.
    <br>
    <br>5. Education, Training, and Information
    <br>Cooperatives provide education and training for their members, elected representatives, managers, and employees so they can contribute effectively to the development of their co-operatives. They inform the general public - particularly young people and opinion leaders - about the nature and benefits of co-operation.
    <br>
    <br>6. Cooperation among Cooperatives
    <br>Cooperatives serve their members most effectively and strengthen the cooperative movement by working together through local, national, regional and international structures.
    <br>
    <br>7. Concern for Community
    <br>Cooperatives work for the sustainable development of their communities through policies approved by their members.

    <br>* McsEngl.{1895}-International-Cooperative-Alliance-creation,
    <br>"The International Cooperative Alliance was founded in London, England on 19 August 1895 during the 1st Cooperative Congress. In attendance were delegates from cooperatives from Argentina, Australia, Belgium, England, Denmark, France, Germany, Holland, India, Italy, Switzerland, Serbia, and the USA.
    <br>Representatives established the International Cooperative Alliance's aims to provide information, define and defend the Cooperative Principles and develop international trade. It was one of the only international organisations to survive both World War I and World War II.
    <br>Overcoming all the political differences between its members was difficult, but the ICA survived by staying committed to peace, democracy, and by remaining politically neutral."

    <br>"Housing coops come in many forms. Some coops are townhouses and small buildings with just a handful of units. Others are large apartment-style buildings with hundreds of units. Coops are different from private rental housing because the residents decide how the coop is operated. Every member gets a vote in approving annual budgets, electing directors and setting policies on the coop’s overall direction."

    <br>">education system:
    <br>An education system is the network of institutions and organizations that provide formal education to a population. It encompasses all levels of education, from early childhood education to higher education. The purpose of an education system is to provide individuals with the knowledge, skills, and values they need to become productive members of society.
    <br>
    <br>**Structure of an education system**
    <br>The structure of an education system varies from country to country, but there are some common elements. Most education systems are divided into three levels:
    <br>* **Early childhood education (ECE)**: ECE is for children from birth to age five. It is designed to help children develop their social, emotional, and cognitive skills.
    <br>* **Primary education:** Primary education is for children from age five to age eleven. It is designed to teach children the basic skills they need to succeed in life, such as reading, writing, and arithmetic.
    <br>* **Secondary education:** Secondary education is for children from age eleven to age eighteen. It is designed to provide students with a more specialized education that prepares them for college or the workforce.
    <br>
    <br>**Types of education systems**
    <br>There are two main types of education systems:
    <br>* **Public education systems:** Public education systems are funded by the government and are open to all students.
    <br>* **Private education systems:** Private education systems are not funded by the government and are typically selective in their admissions.
    <br>
    <br>**Challenges facing education systems**
    <br>Education systems around the world face a number of challenges, including:
    <br>* **Providing access to quality education for all students:** There are still many children around the world who do not have access to quality education. This is often due to factors such as poverty, conflict, and discrimination.
    <br>* **Ensuring that education is relevant to the needs of the workforce:** The workforce is constantly changing, and education systems need to adapt to meet the needs of employers.
    <br>* **Addressing the achievement gap:** There is a significant achievement gap between students from different socioeconomic backgrounds. This gap is often due to factors such as access to resources and early childhood education.
    <br>
    <br>**Future of education**
    <br>The future of education is likely to be shaped by a number of trends, including:
    <br>* **The rise of technology:** Technology is playing an increasingly important role in education. This is leading to the development of new teaching methods and learning tools.
    <br>* **The globalization of education:** Education is becoming increasingly globalized, with students from all over the world studying together. This is creating new opportunities for collaboration and exchange.
    <br>* **The increasing focus on lifelong learning:** Education is no longer confined to the classroom. People are increasingly learning throughout their lives, from formal courses to informal learning opportunities.
    <br>
    <br>The education system plays a vital role in preparing individuals for the challenges and opportunities of the future. By addressing the challenges and adapting to new trends, education systems can ensure that all students have the opportunity to succeed."

    <br>"Tertiary education, also known as post-secondary education, is the educational level following the completion of secondary education. It encompasses a wide range of institutions and programs, including universities, colleges, technical training institutes, and vocational schools.
    <br>Tertiary education can be academic or vocational in nature. Academic programs typically lead to an undergraduate or graduate degree, while vocational programs prepare students for specific jobs or trades. Tertiary education can be full-time, part-time, or online.
    <br>There are many benefits to pursuing tertiary education. Graduates of tertiary education have higher earnings, lower unemployment rates, and better health outcomes than those without a college degree. Tertiary education also helps people develop critical thinking skills, problem-solving skills, and communication skills. These skills are essential for success in the workplace and in life.
    <br>Here are some of the benefits of tertiary education:
    <br>* Higher earning potential: Graduates of tertiary education typically earn more than those without a college degree.
    <br>* Lower unemployment rates: Graduates of tertiary education have lower unemployment rates than those without a college degree.
    <br>* Better health outcomes: Graduates of tertiary education are more likely to have health insurance and to be in good health than those without a college degree.
    <br>* Improved job satisfaction: Graduates of tertiary education are more likely to be satisfied with their jobs than those without a college degree.
    <br>* Increased civic engagement: Graduates of tertiary education are more likely to vote and volunteer than those without a college degree.
    <br>Tertiary education is also important for economic growth and development. Countries with a high-skilled workforce are more competitive in the global economy.
    <br>If you are considering pursuing tertiary education, there are many factors to consider, such as your interests, your career goals, and your financial situation. There are many different types of tertiary institutions and programs available, so it is important to do your research and find the right one for you."

    <br>· "A startup or start-up is a company or project undertaken by an entrepreneur to seek, develop, and validate a scalable business model.[1][2] While entrepreneurship includes all new businesses, including self-employment and businesses that do not intend to go public, startups are new businesses that intend to grow large beyond the solo founder.[3] At the beginning, startups face high uncertainty[4] and have high rates of failure, but a minority of them do go on to be successful and influential.[5]"

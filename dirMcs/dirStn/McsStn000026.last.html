    <br>">global non-service-sector percentage in economy:
    <br>As of 2023, the non-service sector (including agriculture, manufacturing, and construction) accounts for about 25% of the global economy. The service sector, on the other hand, accounts for about 75% of the global economy. This means that the service sector is much larger than the non-service sector in terms of both value and employment.
    <br>
    <br>The trend of growing service sector dominance is expected to continue, with the World Bank projecting that the service sector will account for 80% of the global economy by 2030. This is due to a number of factors, including:
    <br>* **The increasing demand for services:** As economies develop, people become more wealthy and have more disposable income, which they spend on services such as education, entertainment, and healthcare.
    <br>* **The rise of technology:** Technology is making it easier for businesses to provide services, which is driving down costs and increasing efficiency.
    <br>* **Globalization:** Globalization is making it easier for businesses to trade services across borders, which is creating new opportunities for growth.
    <br>
    <br>The growing dominance of the service sector has a number of implications for economies around the world. One implication is that countries will need to focus on developing their service sectors to be competitive in the global economy. Another implication is that there will be a shift in employment from the manufacturing and agricultural sectors to the service sector. This will require workers to adapt their skills to the new demands of the economy.
    <br>
    <br>Overall, the growing dominance of the service sector is a trend that is likely to continue, and it will have a significant impact on economies around the world."
    <br>[{2023-12-13 retrieved} https://bard.google.com/chat/21c1a3c934180608]
    <br>
    <br>"As of 2023, the global economy shows significant variation in the distribution of sectors. In the United States, for example, the service sector makes up nearly 78% of GDP. This trend is also observed in other major economies, with a growing share of GDP coming from services. For instance, in China, the service sector contributes to almost 54% of the total economic output. In contrast, agriculture continues to be a significant part of India’s GDP, accounting for a considerable portion of employment. The global shift towards a service-dominated economy is expected to continue, with projections suggesting the service sector could make up 77% of global GDP by 2035【https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cp/gdp-by-country-sector-breakdown/】."

    <br>">industries of service-sector:
    <br>The service sector, also known as the tertiary sector, plays a critical role in modern economies, encompassing a wide range of industries that provide services rather than goods. Here's an overview of some key industries within the service sector:
    <br>

    <br>">tourism sector:
    <br>The tourism sector encompasses a wide range of services and industries that cater to people traveling for leisure, business, or other reasons. It is a significant component of the global economy and plays a crucial role in the economic development of many countries. Here are key aspects of the tourism sector:
    <br>1. **Components**: The tourism sector includes accommodations (hotels, resorts, and guest houses), transportation services (airlines, car rentals, and cruise ships), food and beverage services (restaurants and cafes), travel agencies and tour operators, and attractions (museums, historical sites, parks, and entertainment venues).
    <br>2. **Economic Impact**: Tourism is a major source of income for many countries and can significantly contribute to a country's GDP. It creates jobs, generates revenue from foreign exchange, and stimulates the growth of the local economy.
    <br>3. **Cultural and Environmental Impact**: While tourism can promote cultural exchange and preservation, it can also lead to cultural commodification and environmental degradation if not managed sustainably. Issues such as overtourism and the carbon footprint of travel are growing concerns.
    <br>4. **Sustainable Tourism**: There is a growing emphasis on sustainable tourism, which seeks to minimize the environmental impact and ensure that tourism development is ecologically, economically, and socially sustainable. This includes eco-tourism, community tourism, and responsible tourism practices.
    <br>5. **Trends and Challenges**: The tourism sector is influenced by global trends such as digital transformation, changing consumer preferences towards experiential travel, and the need for personalized services. Challenges include dealing with the impacts of climate change, ensuring the safety and security of travelers, and adapting to geopolitical changes.
    <br>6. **COVID-19 Impact and Recovery**: The COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact on the tourism sector, leading to travel restrictions, a decline in international tourism, and significant economic losses. The sector is in the process of recovery, focusing on health and safety measures, promoting domestic tourism, and leveraging technology to enhance traveler experiences.
    <br>7. **Future Outlook**: The future of tourism involves integrating technology such as virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance the planning and travel experience, developing sustainable tourism practices, and adapting to the evolving needs and preferences of travelers.
    <br>The tourism sector is dynamic and resilient, continually adapting to external pressures and changing consumer behaviors. Its ability to innovate and embrace sustainable practices will be crucial for its long-term success and positive impact on communities around the world."

    <br>">trade-sector statistics:
    <br>Trade-sector statistics provide valuable insights into the global economy, allowing governments, businesses, and individuals to understand the flow of goods and services across borders. These statistics can be used to track trends, identify opportunities, and assess the impact of trade policies.
    <br>**Key trade-sector statistics include:**
    <br>* **Import and export volumes and values:** This data shows the quantity and monetary value of goods and services that a country imports and exports.
    <br>* **Trade balance:** This measure indicates whether a country is running a trade surplus (exporting more than it imports) or a trade deficit (importing more than it exports).
    <br>* **Share of trade in GDP:** This metric shows the proportion of a country's gross domestic product (GDP) that is generated by trade.
    <br>* **Import and export composition by sector:** This data breaks down trade by industry, such as agriculture, manufacturing, and services.
    <br>* **Top trading partners:** This information identifies the countries with which a country conducts the most trade.
    <br>**Sources of trade-sector statistics:**
    <br>* **World Trade Organization (WTO):** The WTO provides comprehensive trade statistics for WTO members and other major trading partners.
    <br>* **International Monetary Fund (IMF):** The IMF's World Economic Outlook provides trade statistics for all countries.
    <br>* **National statistical agencies:** Many countries have their own statistical agencies that collect and publish trade data.

    <br>">trade definition:
    <br>Trade refers to the exchange of goods, services, or both, between two or more parties. It can occur on a domestic level within the same country or on an international level between different countries. Trade is fundamental to the economy because it allows for the specialization of production, increased efficiency, and the distribution of resources and products to where they are most valued. It typically involves the buying and selling of products or services, with money acting as a medium of exchange, although barter trade (the direct exchange of goods and services without the use of money) still exists in some contexts. The terms of trade are influenced by factors such as supply and demand, tariffs, trade policies, and the overall economic conditions of the trading entities."

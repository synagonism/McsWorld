    <br>">global non-service-sector percentage in economy:
    <br>As of 2023, the non-service sector (including agriculture, manufacturing, and construction) accounts for about 25% of the global economy. The service sector, on the other hand, accounts for about 75% of the global economy. This means that the service sector is much larger than the non-service sector in terms of both value and employment.
    <br>
    <br>The trend of growing service sector dominance is expected to continue, with the World Bank projecting that the service sector will account for 80% of the global economy by 2030. This is due to a number of factors, including:
    <br>* **The increasing demand for services:** As economies develop, people become more wealthy and have more disposable income, which they spend on services such as education, entertainment, and healthcare.
    <br>* **The rise of technology:** Technology is making it easier for businesses to provide services, which is driving down costs and increasing efficiency.
    <br>* **Globalization:** Globalization is making it easier for businesses to trade services across borders, which is creating new opportunities for growth.
    <br>
    <br>The growing dominance of the service sector has a number of implications for economies around the world. One implication is that countries will need to focus on developing their service sectors to be competitive in the global economy. Another implication is that there will be a shift in employment from the manufacturing and agricultural sectors to the service sector. This will require workers to adapt their skills to the new demands of the economy.
    <br>
    <br>Overall, the growing dominance of the service sector is a trend that is likely to continue, and it will have a significant impact on economies around the world."
    <br>[{2023-12-13 retrieved} https://bard.google.com/chat/21c1a3c934180608]
    <br>
    <br>"As of 2023, the global economy shows significant variation in the distribution of sectors. In the United States, for example, the service sector makes up nearly 78% of GDP. This trend is also observed in other major economies, with a growing share of GDP coming from services. For instance, in China, the service sector contributes to almost 54% of the total economic output. In contrast, agriculture continues to be a significant part of India’s GDP, accounting for a considerable portion of employment. The global shift towards a service-dominated economy is expected to continue, with projections suggesting the service sector could make up 77% of global GDP by 2035【https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cp/gdp-by-country-sector-breakdown/】."

    <br>

    <br>
    <br>8. **Transportation and Logistics**: This sector covers the transportation of people and goods (air, rail, road, water) and logistics services like warehousing and supply chain management.
    <br>

    <br>
    <br>10. **Public Administration and Safety**: Government services such as administration, defense, public order, and safety are also part of the service sector.
    <br>
    <br>Each of these industries plays a distinct role in the economy, contributing to employment, economic growth, and the overall quality of life.

    <br>">tourism sector:
    <br>The tourism sector encompasses a wide range of services and industries that cater to people traveling for leisure, business, or other reasons. It is a significant component of the global economy and plays a crucial role in the economic development of many countries. Here are key aspects of the tourism sector:
    <br>1. **Components**: The tourism sector includes accommodations (hotels, resorts, and guest houses), transportation services (airlines, car rentals, and cruise ships), food and beverage services (restaurants and cafes), travel agencies and tour operators, and attractions (museums, historical sites, parks, and entertainment venues).
    <br>2. **Economic Impact**: Tourism is a major source of income for many countries and can significantly contribute to a country's GDP. It creates jobs, generates revenue from foreign exchange, and stimulates the growth of the local economy.
    <br>3. **Cultural and Environmental Impact**: While tourism can promote cultural exchange and preservation, it can also lead to cultural commodification and environmental degradation if not managed sustainably. Issues such as overtourism and the carbon footprint of travel are growing concerns.
    <br>4. **Sustainable Tourism**: There is a growing emphasis on sustainable tourism, which seeks to minimize the environmental impact and ensure that tourism development is ecologically, economically, and socially sustainable. This includes eco-tourism, community tourism, and responsible tourism practices.

    <br>"Travel Authorization: A visa is an official document or stamp in a passport that permits a foreign national to enter, stay in, or leave a country for a specified purpose and duration. Visas are typically categorized based on the nature of the visit, such as tourist, business, student, or work visas. The application process, requirements, and validity periods vary by country and visa type. Some countries also offer electronic visas (e-visas) or electronic travel authorizations (ETAs) to streamline the process.

    <br>">trade-sector statistics:
    <br>Trade-sector statistics provide valuable insights into the global economy, allowing governments, businesses, and individuals to understand the flow of goods and services across borders. These statistics can be used to track trends, identify opportunities, and assess the impact of trade policies.
    <br>**Key trade-sector statistics include:**
    <br>* **Import and export volumes and values:** This data shows the quantity and monetary value of goods and services that a country imports and exports.
    <br>* **Trade balance:** This measure indicates whether a country is running a trade surplus (exporting more than it imports) or a trade deficit (importing more than it exports).
    <br>* **Share of trade in GDP:** This metric shows the proportion of a country's gross domestic product (GDP) that is generated by trade.
    <br>* **Import and export composition by sector:** This data breaks down trade by industry, such as agriculture, manufacturing, and services.
    <br>* **Top trading partners:** This information identifies the countries with which a country conducts the most trade.
    <br>**Sources of trade-sector statistics:**
    <br>* **World Trade Organization (WTO):** The WTO provides comprehensive trade statistics for WTO members and other major trading partners.
    <br>* **International Monetary Fund (IMF):** The IMF's World Economic Outlook provides trade statistics for all countries.
    <br>* **National statistical agencies:** Many countries have their own statistical agencies that collect and publish trade data.
    <br>* **Trade data providers:** Private companies offer trade data subscription services that provide more detailed and up-to-date information.
    <br>**Uses of trade-sector statistics:**
    <br>* **Government policy:** Governments use trade-sector statistics to inform trade policy decisions, such as negotiating trade agreements and setting tariffs.
    <br>* **Business strategy:** Businesses use trade-sector statistics to identify export opportunities, assess market potential, and make informed investment decisions.
    <br>* **Individual decision-making:** Consumers and investors can use trade-sector statistics to understand the impact of trade on prices and economic conditions.
    <br>**Examples of how trade-sector statistics are used:**
    <br>* A government might use trade-sector statistics to identify industries that are exporting at a high rate and provide support to those industries to maintain their competitiveness.
    <br>* A business might use trade-sector statistics to assess the market potential for a new product in a foreign market and determine whether to invest in export marketing.
    <br>* An investor might use trade-sector statistics to evaluate the economic prospects of a particular country and make informed investment decisions.
    <br>**Conclusion:**
    <br>Trade-sector statistics are essential tools for understanding the global economy and making informed decisions about trade policy, business strategy, and individual investments. By using trade-sector statistics effectively, individuals can contribute to a more informed and prosperous global economy."

    <br>">trade definition:
    <br>Trade refers to the exchange of goods, services, or both, between two or more parties. It can occur on a domestic level within the same country or on an international level between different countries. Trade is fundamental to the economy because it allows for the specialization of production, increased efficiency, and the distribution of resources and products to where they are most valued. It typically involves the buying and selling of products or services, with money acting as a medium of exchange, although barter trade (the direct exchange of goods and services without the use of money) still exists in some contexts. The terms of trade are influenced by factors such as supply and demand, tariffs, trade policies, and the overall economic conditions of the trading entities."

    <br>">trade vs commerce:
    <br>"Trade" and "commerce" are closely related concepts, but they differ in scope and focus.
    <br>### **Trade**
    <br>- **Definition:** Trade refers to the exchange of goods and services between two or more parties. This can occur at various levels—between individuals, businesses, or even nations.
    <br>- **Scope:** The scope of trade is relatively narrow, focusing on the act of buying and selling. It can be domestic (within a country) or international (between countries).
    <br>- **Types:**
    <br>  - **Domestic Trade:** Within the same country.
    <br>  - **International Trade:** Between different countries (exporting and importing).
    <br>- **Example:** A farmer selling produce to a grocery store, or a company in the U.S. importing electronics from China.
    <br>### **Commerce**
    <br>- **Definition:** Commerce is a broader concept that encompasses all activities related to the exchange of goods and services. It includes trade but also covers other aspects such as transportation, insurance, warehousing, advertising, and banking.
    <br>- **Scope:** The scope of commerce is much broader, involving all the steps necessary to bring goods and services from producers to consumers.
    <br>- **Components:**
    <br>  - **Trade:** The core activity of buying and selling.
    <br>  - **Auxiliary Services:** Activities that facilitate trade, like logistics, finance, communication, and legal services.
    <br>- **Example:** The entire process of bringing a product from the manufacturing stage to the final consumer, including advertising, shipping, warehousing, and retailing.
    <br>### **Key Differences**
    <br>1. **Scope:** Trade is a part of commerce; commerce includes trade plus all the associated services that make trade possible.
    <br>2. **Focus:** Trade focuses on the transaction itself, while commerce is concerned with the entire supply chain and network that supports trade.
    <br>3. **Complexity:** Commerce involves a complex network of activities, whereas trade is a more straightforward exchange of goods and services.
    <br>In summary, while trade and commerce are interrelated, trade is a component of the broader system of commerce."

    <br>**Trade vs. Commerce**
    <br>Trade and commerce are closely related terms, both essential to the functioning of economies, but they have distinct meanings.
    <br>**Trade**
    <br>* **Definition:** The direct exchange of goods and services between two or more parties. It often involves buying and selling for money.
    <br>* **Focus:** Primarily on the act of exchange itself.
    <br>* **Scope:** Can be between individuals, businesses, or even countries (international trade).
    <br>**Commerce**
    <br>* **Definition:**  The broader set of activities that facilitate trade and the movement of goods and services from producers to consumers.
    <br>* **Focus:**  On the entire process, including activities like transportation, banking, insurance, marketing, and warehousing.
    <br>* **Scope:** Encompasses all aspects that enable and support trade, making it a more comprehensive term.
    <br>**Key Differences**
    <br>* **Scope:** Commerce is broader, encompassing trade as one of its components.
    <br>* **Focus:** Trade centers on the exchange itself, while commerce covers the entire ecosystem supporting the exchange.
    <br>* **Activities:** Trade involves buying and selling. Commerce includes trade plus activities like transportation, financing, and marketing.
    <br>**In a nutshell:** Trade is the act of exchanging goods and services. Commerce is the larger system that enables and supports trade activities.
    <br>**Example**
    <br>* A farmer selling apples at a local market is engaged in **trade**.
    <br>* The transportation of those apples from the farm to the market, the banking system used for payment, and the marketing efforts to promote the apples are all part of **commerce**. "

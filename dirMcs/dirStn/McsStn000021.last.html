    <br>"The term global village describes the phenomenon of the world becoming more interconnected as the result of the propagation of media technologies throughout the world. The term was first coined by Canadian media theorist, Marshall McLuhan and popularized in his books The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man (1962) and Understanding Media (1964).[1] Literary scholar Sue-Im describes how the term global village has come to designate “the dominant term for expressing a global coexistence altered by transnational commerce, migration, and culture” (as cited in Poll, 2012).[2] Economic journalist Thomas Friedman's definition of the global village as a world “tied together into a single globalized marketplace and village” is another popular contemporary understanding of the term (as cited in Poll, 2012).[2]"

    <br>"Global population is likely to peak well before the end of the century. Given that we forecasted that societies tend towards a TFR lower than 1·5, once global population decline begins, it will probably continue inexorably. Within the declining total world population some countries will sustain their populations through liberal immigration policies and social policies more supportive of females working and achieving their desired family size. These countries are likely to have larger overall GDP than other countries, with the various economic, social, and geopolitical benefits that come with stable working-age populations. Our UIs and scenario analysis showed that for no country or territory is the demographic future cast in stone. Policies that countries pursue today can alter the trajectory for fertility, mortality, and migration. Population size and composition are not exogenous factors for countries to account for in their planning, but rather outcomes that they can help direct."

    <br>"While working on the Peakbagger.com web site, a common need was a definitive list of the countries in the world. While it may seem like a straightforward task to come up with a list like this, the complexity of the modern political world is very difficult to unravel in a consistent manner. In the end, I came up with a list of 253 countries (and country equivalents) that together contain every square inch of the earth's land surface in a complete and non-overlapping coverage. This list was used to assign peaks to countries, come up with country high point lists, and so on. Since this list is used quite a bit, I thought it important to explain and justify how it came about and where the magic number 253 comes from."

    <br>"Who Owns Most of England?
    <br>Last Modified Date: November 08, 2020
    <br>The growing divide between the "haves" and the "have-nots" has been a hot-button issue for ages, but perhaps nowhere illustrates it better than England.
    <br>In his book Who Owns England, author Guy Shrubsole reveals a shocking fact: Less than 1 percent of the English population -- approximately 25,000 people -- own half of the nation's land. Shrubsole also calculates that in a completely equitable society, every resident of England would be entitled to just over a half-acre of soil.
    <br>Of course, the world isn't perfect, which explains why much of England is in the possession of the Queen, entrepreneur James Dyson, the Duke of Buccleuch, and other members of the aristocracy, as well as corporations.
    <br>At least one British politician welcomed the findings. "It’s simply not right that aristocrats, whose families have owned the same areas of land for centuries, and large corporations exercise more influence over local neighborhoods – in both urban and rural areas – than the people who live there," Labour MP Jon Trickett told The Guardian newspaper. "Land is a source of wealth; it impacts on house prices, it is a source of food, and it can provide enjoyment for millions of people."
    <br>Who owns the world?
    <br>Technically speaking, the largest landowners include Queen Elizabeth II, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, Pope Benedict, King Mohammed VI of Morocco, and King Bhumibhol of Thailand.
    <br>In the United States, media tycoon John Malone owns the most land, with 2.2 million acres; fellow media mogul Ted Turner is second, claiming 2 million acres.
    <br>Venezuela has the most land outside of private control; nearly 54 percent of its land area is protected by the government."

    <br>"Globalization or globalisation is the process of interaction and integration among people, companies, and governments worldwide. As a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, globalization is considered by some as a form of capitalist expansion which entails the integration of local and national economies into a global, unregulated market economy.[1] Globalization has grown due to advances in transportation and communication technology. With the increased global interactions comes the growth of international trade, ideas, and culture. Globalization is primarily an economic process of interaction and integration that's associated with social and cultural aspects. However, conflicts and diplomacy are also large parts of the history of globalization, and modern globalization.
    <br>Economically, globalization involves goods, services, the economic resources of capital, technology, and data.[2] Also, the expansions of global markets liberalize the economic activities of the exchange of goods and funds. Removal of cross-border trade barriers has made formation of global markets more feasible.[citation needed] The steam locomotive, steamship, jet engine, and container ships are some of the advances in the means of transport while the rise of the telegraph and its modern offspring, the Internet and mobile phones show development in telecommunications infrastructure. All of these improvements have been major factors in globalization and have generated further interdependence of economic and cultural activities around the globe.[3][4][5]
    <br>Though many scholars place the origins of globalization in modern times, others trace its history long before the European Age of Discovery and voyages to the New World, some even to the third millennium BC.[6] Large-scale globalization began in the 1820s.[7] In the late 19th century and early 20th century, the connectivity of the world's economies and cultures grew very quickly. The term globalization is recent, only establishing its current meaning in the 1970s.[8]
    <br>In 2000, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) identified four basic aspects of globalization: trade and transactions, capital and investment movements, migration and movement of people, and the dissemination of knowledge.[9] Further, environmental challenges such as global warming, cross-boundary water, air pollution, and over-fishing of the ocean are linked with globalization.[10] Globalizing processes affect and are affected by business and work organization, economics, socio-cultural resources, and the natural environment. Academic literature commonly subdivides globalization into three major areas: economic globalization, cultural globalization, and political globalization.[11]"
